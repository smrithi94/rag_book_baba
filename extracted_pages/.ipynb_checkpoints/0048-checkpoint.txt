HAPPENINGS 31
Other instances of Baba's powers of resurrection are known to other 
devotees. The Raja of Ventagiri told me of his experience when, 
some twenty or so years ago, he witnessed Baba's resurrection of a 
man dead some six days in whom body decomposition was taking its 
normal course. About these mysteries, one can make no comment; 
they are outside the customary human experience.
Detachment, Faith, and Love — these are the pillars on which 
Peace rests. Of these, Faith is crucial. For, without it, Sadhana (
spiritual practice) is an empty rite. Detachment alone can make 
Sadhana effective and Love leads quickly to God. Faith feeds the 
agony of separation from God; detachment canalises it along the 
path of God; Love lights the way. God will grant you what you 
need and deserve; there is no need to ask, no reason to grumble. 
Be content, be grateful whatever happens, whenever it happens. 
Nothing can happen against His Will.
— Sathya Sai Baba
