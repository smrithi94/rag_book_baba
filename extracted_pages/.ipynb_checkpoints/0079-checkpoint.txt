62 MY BABA AND I
What could 1 do? It would not do to press the question, so I had to 
abandon what would have been the perfect way to pinpoint my 
principal faults. Why would Baba not tell? One has to suppose that 
it would not be of real benefit to me if he told me. Perhaps the 
deep and vital faults have to be found by oneself.
Let the petty wishes for which you now approach God be 
realised or not, let the plans for promotion and progress which 
you place before God, be fulfilled or not; they are not so 
important after all. The primary aim should be to become 
Masters of yourselves, to hold intimate and constant 
communion with the Divine that is in you as well as in the 
Universe of which you are a part. Welcome disappointment, for 
they toughen you and test your fortitude.
— Sathya Sai Baba
