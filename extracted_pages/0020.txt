Our First Meeting with
Sri Sathya Sai Baba
My wife and I first heard of Baba in 1968 through a description of 
him given to a friend of mine by a lady who had visited India. She 
had brought back some sacred ash (vibhuti), a beautiful ring as a gift 
to her from the miraculous nature of Baba, and she had many 
fascinating stories to tell. One special remark struck fire. The lady 
said she had felt a change in her character while with Baba, and the 
change persisted even after she returned home. This statement had a 
strong impact on my mind. Could there be a man, was there a man 
living today whose being was so subtle, so powerful, so mysterious, 
so divine that he could change the human heart?
If it were indeed true that such a man lived in today's world, then 
nothing else in my life could equal the urgency of seeking him out. I 
prayed that through his grace and kindness, he might touch my dry 
heart and make it alive and vibrant again.
My wife and I heard the story of Baba on a Monday, and the same 
week we were aboard a plane to India.
I should not imply that my faith was able to keep up with the eager 
rush of my heart, but my intellectual doubts, which had gained 
considerable strength during the journey, were unable to survive even 
the first meeting with Baba. In his presence, doubt is like very 
shallow water in the burning sun — in no time at all it disappears.
