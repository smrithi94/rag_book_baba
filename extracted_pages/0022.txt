HAPPENINGS 5
How could Sri Sathya Sai Baba, a stranger never seen before, come 
into the heart of a mature man and bring about a change from within, 
a change from which there is no turning back? Surely, the Divine is 
the only Stranger who can do this.
The happiness that has come with Baba's presence becomes still 
more intense when he answers questions and speaks of matters 
spiritual. The depth and wisdom of his words carry such a thrill of 
truth that it almost seems that one's consciousness cannot bear the 
intense joy that fills heart and mind. Whereas the senses report that 
Swami is a man, the more subtle levels of perception are not 
satisfied with that explanation. The deeper awareness only serves 
to sharpen the question, Who is Baba? How can one ever penetrate 
such a mystery and know the truth?
God is all-pervading, but, yet, we have some scientists who 
assert, "We have searched all outer space, we have looked for 
Him on the moon; no, He is nowhere to be found. He does not 
exist." They do not know what to seek and where, still, they 
have the impudence to assert that it is not found. Is God an 
occupant of an identifiable body or form. Has He a habitation 
and a habiliment that is traditionally His? God is all this and 
more; He is in all this and beyond. He is the inner motivator of 
the very scientist who "denies" Him! Man himself is God; all 
matter, even in the moon, is suffused with the Divine Presence. 
To search for God with the instruments in the laboratory is like 
trying to cure pain in the stomach by pouring drops into the 
eye! There is a technique and a special instrument for that 
purpose which the past masters in that science have developed 
and spoken about. Equip yourselves with a clear eye through 
detachment and love, sharpen your sense of discrimination so 
that it has no prejudice or predilection, then you can see God in 
you, around you, in all that you know and feel and are.
— Sathya Sai Baba
