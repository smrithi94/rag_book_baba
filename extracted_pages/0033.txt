16 MY BABA AND I
Baba was this love was equally unmistakable. It seemed to me 
that only God Himself could enter my heart as love and, since 
then, this feeling of the Divine Presence has never changed. 
About how others view Baba, I am afraid I am totally indifferent, 
for there is no way I can deny my own direct experience. I 
became an instant devotee of the divine Baba and happily remain 
so. I found to my great surprise that although I had always used 
an intellectual approach to spiritual life, the devotional path was 
at once very natural to me as soon as I encountered Baba. What 
the future holds for me, I do not know. Nor do I think very much 
about it. To the extent that my attention can stay with this 
moment, conscious of the immediate Presence of the ever-loving, 
ever-caring Lord; to that extent, thoughts of the future are not a 
worry or a bother to me.
He is in you, and it is God that has prompted you to project 
Him into the outer world, as this idol or that image, to listen to 
your outpouring and give you peace. Without the inspiration, 
solace, and joy that He confers from within, you will be raving 
mad, as one who has lost his moorings and is tossed about, 
rudderless on a stormy sea. Hold on to Him in the heart, hear 
Him whisper in the silent words of counsel and consolation. 
Hold converse with Him, guide your footsteps as He directs, 
and you reach the goal, safe and soon. The picture before which 
you sit, the flowers which you place on it, the hymns you recite, 
the vows you impose on yourselves, the vigils you go through —
these are activities that cleanse, that remove obstacles in the 
way of your getting aware of the God within.
— Sathya Sai Baba
