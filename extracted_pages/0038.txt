HAPPENINGS 21
for his book, Vision of the Divine. He showed the memo to Baba. 
After reading the memo, Baba said the event had occurred as 
described and that the significance attributed to it was correct.
It might be thought that the story of the cross was now complete, but 
there is still a sequel. In 1975, I made an unannounced trip to India to 
consult with Baba about arrangements for a visit to America that we 
hoped he would undertake. Swami had not been informed of my visit 
and was away on tour when I arrived. On that day he was having 
lunch with a few senior devotees and he said, "Hislop arrived in 
Bangalore just now and is waiting."
One of the men at the table (who later told me of the scene) 
remarked, "You made a crucifix for him."
Baba replied, "Yes, I made it for him. And when I went to look for 
the wood, every particle of the cross had disintegrated and had 
returned to the elements. I reached out to the elements and 
reconstituted sufficient material for a small cross. Very seldom does 
Swami interfere with Nature, but occasionally, for a devotee, it will 
be done."
Base your action on knowledge, the knowledge that all is One. 
Let the action be suffused with bhakti; that is to say, humility, 
love, mercy, and non-violence. Let bhakti be filled with 
knowledge, otherwise it will be as light as a balloon which drifts 
along any current of air, or gust of wind. Mere knowledge will 
make the heart dry; bhakti makes it soft with sympathy, and 
karma gives the hands something to do, something which will 
sanctify every one of the minutes that have fallen to your lot to 
live.
— Sathya Sai Baba
