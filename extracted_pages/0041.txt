24 MY BABA AND I
(Hislop was standing by the side of that table), it was 
noticed that the cardboard box which contained the four 
was dripping tears! The saris were weeping that they 
could not get appreciation from me and were declared 
unfit. Yes! They had shed tears! You may ask whether 
this is ever possible. I answer, there is nothing in this 
world which has no heart, which is incapable of feeling 
joy or grief! Only, you must have the eye to see, the ear 
to listen, the heart to respond.
When, in the Dharmakshetra in Bombay, Baba had finished telling 
us the story about the mountain peak in the time of Sri Rama, some 
ten thousand years or more ago, and of the Govard-hana Peak in the 
time of Sri Krishna, some five thousand years ago, I exclaimed, "
Swami! The self-same drama that occurred in the time of Rama and 
again in the time of Krishna was played again here today in this 
very room!"
Baba replied, "Yes. And with the self-same Rama and the selfsame 
Krishna here again today in this very room!"
As was the case with the rejected mountain peak, the rejected saris 
received the compassion of the Lord, and they were presented to the 
ladies in Baba's party to be used by them. In fact, my wife received 
one of the saris, and the sari receives plenty of appreciation from 
her!
The morning shadow moves in front of you. However fast you 
run, you cannot catch it, on plain or mountain. Or, the shadow 
may pursue you and you cannot escape from it. This is the nature 
of desire. You may pursue it or it may pursue you — but you 
cannot overcome it or catch it. Desire is an insubstantial 
shadow. But turn desire inward, towards spiritual treasure, then 
it yields substantial results.
