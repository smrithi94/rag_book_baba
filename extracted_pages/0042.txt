A Mirror of the Moon
Early on the morning of Dec. 8, 1973, Swami departed Pra-
santhi Nilayam for Brindavan. After an hour or so of driving, he 
directed the three accompanying cars to turn off the road to a 
clearing in an uninhabited area of the forest. Everyone got out. 
Baba was in a delightful mood, moving about among the party 
and cracking jokes with the men.
Beside the picnic area was a wood-apple tree with a few large 
wood-apples in view in the upper branches. The men tried to 
knock some of these to the ground by throwing stones, but with-
out success. One small wood-apple, about two inches in diameter, 
did fall to the ground, and Baba picked it up.
Holding the small wood-apple between thumb and forefinger 
against the morning sun, Baba said, "Here is the moon." Then he 
closed the small object in his hand for a moment, and when his 
hand opened, the wood-apple had disappeared, and in its place 
there was a most extraordinary object.
The object was a translucent disk (of stone?) thin at the edges and 
thicker at the centre. It reflected light in a brilliant way, and 
throughout its body there was a puzzling variety of modifications. 
There were dark areas of uneven shape and size; there were short and 
longer veins of luminous mineral-like materials of all shades
