HAPPENINGS 27
After we had all admired the golden light, Swami again closed his 
hand, the moon-disk was gone, and in its place was the original small 
wood-apple. Baba tossed it to me, and it is at our house as one of the 
objects in the shrine room.
By this time, a few strangers had appeared from somewhere, and 
Swami gave them the remaining food. The ladies tidied up the picnic 
ground, we all returned to our cars and resumed the drive to 
Brindavan, thoroughly pleased by the breakfast picnic with Baba.
Have no thorn of hate in your mind, develop love towards all. 
Desire is a storm, greed is a whirlpool, pride is a precipice, 
attachments is an avalanche, egoism is a volcano. Keep these 
things away so that when you recite the name of God or do 
Meditation, they do not disturb the equanimity. Let love be 
enthroned in your heart. Then, there will be sunshine and cool 
breezes and gurgling waters of contentment feeding the roots of 
faith.
— Sathya Sai Baba
