HAPPENINGS 33
contrary, start running to remain close to Baba to the last possible 
moment. How do the villagers know? Nobody has informed them. 
Surely, somehow or other there must have been a rumor, but if so, 
how could it spread so far and so quickly?
When the car arrives at a large town or at a city, great crowds 
assemble; enthusiastic, tearful, and yearning of heart. No matter to 
which household Baba pays a visit, multitudes are gathered and are 
waiting for his arrival. As long as Baba remains there, the civic 
authorities have to contend with the problem of a massive traffic 
congestion. But many of the police are also devotees, and it is hard 
for them to be stern with the people. The mood is not one of 
curiosity, but of wonder, awe, and devotion. All eyes are riveted on 
Baba whenever he appears. People are overcome with their 
emotions; they dissolve in tears and prostrate themselves in honor of 
Sri Baba and in wordless petition for his grace. It is an extraordinary 
scene and an experience that is unique.
In western countries now, God is denied, and man is relying on 
himself. He exaggerates his own intelligence and sense of 
adventure and prides himself on the advance he has made 
through science and technology. But, intelligence without 
equanimity is filling mental hospitals. Peace is fleeing from the 
hearts of men and women; social harmony is becoming a distant 
dream, international concord is a mirage pursued by a few. Man 
travels to the moon, but does not explore his own inner levels of 
consciousness, and understanding them, cleanse them and 
control them.
— Sathya Sai Baba
