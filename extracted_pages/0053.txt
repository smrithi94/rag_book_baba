36 MY BABA AND I
had had the Darshan of Baba in the form of Sri Shirdi Sai, and it 
was this she wanted to verify in her conversation with Baba.
Fascinated with Baba's reply, Victoria started to respond to his 
statement about his presence in the garden in Havana, but he held 
up his hand for silence. He seemed to listen for a moment, then 
said, "Stop the car. One of the cars following us has had a tire 
puncture."
By this time, the caravan had fallen behind us and was not visible. 
We waited, not breaking Baba's silence. Then, looking behind, we 
saw one car rapidly approaching. The driver reported, "The car just 
behind me had a puncture, and I hurried ahead so as to tell Swami. 
The other cars are waiting there."
Well, what happened then was that Swamiji made room for one of 
the individuals from the stranded car, other cars took the rest of the 
people, leaving the driver of the taxi to fix his tire, and Victoria's 
great opportunity to have a further confidential and intimate 
conversation with Baba had come to an end — as all things 
eventually do!
When a tree first shoots forth from the seed, it comes up with a 
stem and two incipient leaves! But, later, when it grows, the 
trunk is one, and the branches are many! Each branch may be 
thick enough to be called a trunk, but one should not forget 
that the roots send food as sap through one single trunk. God, 
the same God, feeds the spiritual hunger of all nations and all 
faiths, through the common sustenance of truth, virtue, 
humility and sacrifice.
— Sathya Sai Baba
