HAPPENINGS 39
Without turning away from Baba, I explained. Baba then said, "What 
Hislop sees is correct."
The questioner then said, "Well, how is it that we do not see it?" 
Baba replied, "It is always there. Anyone can see it at any time. 
Only an intensity of interest is required."
Baba's visit with us was then concluded. He arose and left the room
Unfortunately, there was no opportunity to ask about the stationary 
golden circle, and to this day I have no information or understanding 
about it.
You may say that progress is possible only through My Grace, but 
though My Heart is soft as butter, it melts only when there is some 
warmth in your prayer. Unless you make some disciplined effort, 
some Sadhana, Grace cannot descend on you. The yearning, the 
agony of unfulfilled aim, that is the warmth that melts My Heart. 
That is the anguish that wins Grace.
— Sathya Sai Baba
