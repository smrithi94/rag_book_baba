Baba Protects Our/His Home
By mid-1976, four houses on our hill, Loma De Carmen, had 
crumbled away and had fallen down the several hundred feet to sea 
level, and seven more houses, including ours, were in immediate 
danger.
The community, Villa De San Miguel, is about 100 miles south of 
the U.S. border. The Mexican part of the coast is called Baja 
California. Our house is on a hill with a grand view of ocean, 
islands, and coastline, to the South and West, and to the East, a 
panoramic view of the inland mountains. We had built it as a house 
for Baba in the western world, and much care had gone into its 
planning. The floor-to-ceiling arched windows were all guarded 
with iron, which is advisable here, and 48 Om symbols had been 
worked into the design of the iron grills, which were white like the 
house itself. But now, suddenly, its destiny was uncertain. It would 
soon be destroyed, according to the Mexican geologists and 
engineers. Crevices, appearing in the land, were described as being 
hundreds of feet deep, extending beneath the sea floor. In fact, the 
first slice of the hill to fall had pushed up a portion of the sea floor 
to a height of some 20 feet above the surface of the water. The 
forces of nature in movement on our hill were very powerful 
indeed.
