42 MY BABA AND I
gentle eyes were to the sea, but the raised palm seemed to say to the 
sea, "Thus far, my child, but no further!"
Whatever the reason, and for ourselves we think of no reason other 
than Sai, the house stands solid and unharmed to this very day. The 
earth continues to move in portions of the hill, inevitable damage 
follows, but the Sai home remains unchanged, still waiting to 
welcome a visit from our beloved Baba.
You sit in Meditation for ten minutes after the evening Bhajan 
session; so far, so good. But, let me ask, when you rise after the 
ten minutes and move about, do you see everyone in a clearer 
light as endowed with Divinity? If not, Meditation is a waste of 
time. Do you love more, do you talk less, do you serve others 
more earnestly? These are the signs of success in Meditation. 
Your progress must be authenticated by your character and 
behavior. Meditation must transmute your attitude towards 
beings and things, else it is a hoax. Even a boulder will, through 
the action of sun and rain, heat and cold, disintegrate into mud 
and become food for a tree. Even the hardest heart can be 
softened so that the Divine can sprout therein.
— Sathya Sai Baba
