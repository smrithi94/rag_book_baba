Baba Knows Our Mexican Gardener
In our neighborhood at Villa de San Miguel in Mexico, there is a 
young Mexican man who does gardening. He is poor, and also 
unfortunate; for he has the habit of liquor. He married a nice 
local girl, and a baby had been born just before we left on a visit 
to India.
While we were away, we had arranged with this young man to visit 
our house once a week to water the flowers in the garden.
During the course of an interview granted to us by Baba, on the day 
of our departure from India, he turned to my wife and said, "About 
that servant of yours."
My wife said, "But, Swami, we have no servant."
Baba said, "Yes, but there is a man watering the flowers. Take this 
and give it to the baby." Then, he moved his hand and there appeared 
a medallion on a chain, which he handed to my wife.
My wife exclaimed, "How wonderful! It is a lovely baby, and he is a 
nice man."
Baba responded, "No. He has very serious faults."
