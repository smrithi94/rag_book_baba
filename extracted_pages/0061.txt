Sugar Candy
My wife and I were with Baba to bid him goodbye, for we were 
returning to America. After some time, when the personal 
interview was over, he said, "I want you to give this to Mr. and 
Mrs. Cowan."
He moved his hand in the mode he has adopted to create objects, 
and there appeared a white, soft mass about the size of half of a 
closed fist. He extended his hand and showed it to us. "It is sugar 
candy," he said. Then, in a childlike voice of wonder, "Look, you 
can still see the process of creation."
In the palm of his hand there was water slowly disappearing into the 
mass of sugar candy. He did not explain further, but I took it to 
mean that the movement of creation was from the subtle to the 
gross — space, air, fire, water, and earth.
By the time we arrived in California, the sugar candy was quite hard 
and brittle. Needless to say, Mr. and Mrs. Cowan were overjoyed by 
this mark of Baba's attention to them and his remembrance of 
them.
