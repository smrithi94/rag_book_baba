46 MY BABA AND I
second or so apart. We were stunned. Not one of us recollected 
Baba or called him. We felt we were as good as dead, and we 
instinctively tensed for the crash. But at that very moment some-
thing happened that was without rational explanation. At one 
moment the two cars were upon each other, about to be smashed 
in a fatal head-on collision. The very next moment, the oncoming 
car was behind us, and we were continuing to pass the bus with a 
clear road ahead. Looking backward, we could see the receding 
red tail-lamp of the other car. There was no crash. There was no 
lapse of time; there had been no possibility of a last-moment 
maneuver.
The next day we drove out to Brindavan as usual about 8 a.m. so 
as to be waiting on the veranda for Baba to appear for morning 
Darshan. As soon as he came into the room, I touched the Lotus 
Feet and said, "We want to thank Baba for saving our lives last 
night."
Baba smiled and said, "Yes, that was a close one. You were so 
shocked that not even one of you called for Swami! But, Swami 
saved you anyway." Then he turned to a group of men and in 
Telugu told them the entire story of the incident.
I then said, "Swami, you must have altered time and space in order 
to save us." Baba just smiled and did not answer.
In 1978, I happened to meet Joe King, one of our fellow taxi 
passengers. It was in New York, where he lives. He asked, "Were 
you ever able to figure out what happened that time in the taxi?"
I smiled, shook my head, and said, "No."
