Choosing a Cow in Bangalore
One morning, while the Second International Conference was still 
in the planning stage, Baba took three of us with him in the car on a 
drive to Bangalore. We were going to inspect a site for the 
Conference as suggested by some members of the Central Trust. It 
was their recommendation that Bangalore was a more convenient 
site for the Conference than were other possibilities in Madras, 
Bombay, or Prasanthi Nilayam. A potential site in Bangalore was a 
large park-like property on the eastward boundaries of the city, 
which included buildings suitable for large gatherings.
The proposed Conference site was inspected. Baba noticed 
everything about it, but made no definite comment. Upon leaving 
the area, we drove to the home of a devotee where Baba had ac-
cepted an invitation to lunch. Lunch with Swami at the home of a 
devotee is always a grand occasion which remains alive and trea-
sured in the memories of the family and which becomes a principal 
highlight in the family tradition. Usually, a few close friends have 
been invited by the host, to their extreme delight. Other friends and 
acquaintances suffer a sharp disappointment, but it is clearly 
impossible for the host to agree to all requests. Naturally, the ladies 
of the household are thrilled to the tips of their toes and they have 
been vastly busy with the preparations.
