Gita, Her Destiny
Is To Be a Human Person
Very likely all of Baba's devotees know about his pet elephant, 
Gita, either by directly observing incidents in which she 
partakes, or by hearing stories. She is very much attached to him, 
and he is most kind to her.
On the occasion of festivals and celebrations, Gita is a proud, 
stately, and magnificently decorated member of the ceremonial 
procession, calling to mind the pomp and circumstance of India's 
imperial past. When the celebrations are at Brindavan, Gita will 
walk the long miles from Prasanthi Nilayam, taking a number of

stays for a time in the compound; a member of Baba's sub-human 
family of buffaloes, cows, deer, monkeys, dogs, birds, and cobras. 
She is playful and good-humored except when impatient for Baba 
to appear. One game she very much enjoys is playing with an old 
tire from an automobile. College students who happen to be in the 
compound, will play the game with her for a while. They roll the 
tire full force toward her. She trumpets and, very friskily for an 
individual of her weight, she chases wildly after it, kicking it and 
scampering around it.
