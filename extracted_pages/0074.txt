S ai Krishna
In a way, this story was not completed until November, 1975.
A number of years ago, I was in Baba's car. He was in the rear seat 
with two persons. I was in the front seat with the driver. We were 
on our way to Puttaparthi. Driving in the car with Baba as a 
passenger is a fascinating experience; not only is there the thrill of 
being close to him, but sometimes he will give one the opportunity 
to ask questions. At times he engages in animated conversation in 
Telugu with his companions; and at times he remains silent, mak-
ing the characteristic gesture with his hand that seems to indicate 
that he is giving attention to beings quite invisible to us. And very 
often, he sings bhajans with everyone in the car joining in the 
chorus (except me, who has a musical voice akin to the crow). The 
net result of all this enthralling activity is that my neck is constant-
ly being twisted in order to see what is going on in the back seat. 
Baba understands my plight, but does not advise me to desist; he 
allows me the liberty to turn around. Of course, I do not stare all 
the time. I look only as long as I dare, and then I turn to the front 
again. So, my looking at Baba is intermittent, back-and-forth.
At some point in this journey, perhaps about half-way, Baba was 
talking, and I turned to look. My breathing stopped and I was 
transfixed! I could not credit my eyes. His devotees see Baba's face
