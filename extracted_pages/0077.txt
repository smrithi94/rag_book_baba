60 MY BABA AND I
nesses. I had exclaimed that this had to be the re-enactment on this 
very day, of the famed drama of the mountain that had occurred in 
the Avatharas of Sri Rama and then of Sri Krishna. Baba had 
replied, confirming the statement. He said, "Yes, and it is the self-
same Rama and the self-same Krishna here again today in this very 
room!"
In the light of what has been recited in the preceding pages by me 
as a direct witness and participant, we need never look back with 
even the slightest tinge of envy to those fortunate people who lived 
during those wonderful days of the Krishna Avathara. Because, 
indeed, every time that we have the joy of looking at our beloved 
Sai, we are gazing directly at Sri Krishna. In ages to come, the rich 
experiences of our days will be told and retold as the wondrous 
story of the Sai Avathara.
When the Name is pronounced by the tongue, and the Image is 
adored by the mind, these should not degenerate into mechanical 
routine; the Meaning of the Name and the Content of the Form 
must, at the same time, inspire and illumine the consciousness. 
Escape the routine; involve yourselves in the attitude of worship, 
deeply and sincerely. That is the way to earn peace and 
contentment, for which all human activity ought to be dedicated 
and directed.
— Sathya Sai Baba
