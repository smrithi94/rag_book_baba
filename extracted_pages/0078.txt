For This, One Cannot Look to Baba
One of the puzzles about Baba is his position on criticism. At times, 
he has made kind remarks about me, directly to me, and also to other 
people. This is very pleasant, but at the same time I know only too 
well that I am a faulty man. And, as all men know, if they ever lose 
sight of their imperfections, then their good wives stand ready to 
correct them and bring them back to the true facts of their human 
nature.
But to be informed that one is imperfect is not the same as 
knowing exactly where the fault is. It stands to reason that while 
family and friends may point out personality aspects that annoy 
them, yet they may miss the genuine faults that prevent one from 
realizing the final or ultimate truth as to who and what he really is. 
But there is a person presently alive in this world who sees me 
through and through, and that one is Baba. With this in mind, 
when I was alone with Baba, and there was an opportunity, I asked 
him, "Swamiji, if my essential nature is bliss and freedom, there 
have to be some big faults that prevent me from realizing my 
essential nature. Please point out my big faults to me. That would 
be a great help and I would very much appreciate it."
In response, Baba smiled, shook his head in negation and said, "No. 
No. Just continue as you are doing."
