The Heart May Be Open and Free
A highly valued facet of Sri Sathya Sai Baba, at least it is so for me, 
is that one can love him with all one's heart, without fear and 
without restraint. Every person wants to love greatly, with an open 
heart, but experience has made us afraid.
We may observe how natural it is for young children to love 
wholeheartedly. With what richness and sweetness do very young 
children embrace parents, brothers, sisters, and close playmates! 
How much joy there is for an adult when a child of three or four 
years embraces him with the sweetest of smiles and says, "I love 
you, I love you."
It is the river of love rushing from the open heart of the child that 
makes the child so incredibly sweet and so overflowing with bliss. It 
is this rich treasure of love and affection that touches even the 
dullest adult and makes him share the child's bliss for a moment or 
so.
But, as each of us leaves the innocent open-hearted years of early 
childhood, something very sad and tragic happens. Worldly 
experience invades the shelter of early years, and the heart suffers 
betrayal and rejection. One loves someone and love flows to that 
person. But, if the response is indifference, or a harsh word, or out-
right rejection, then the resultant hurt may be deep and agonizing.
