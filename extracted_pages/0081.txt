64 MY BABA AND I
The child tries again and again, and here and there he is hurt again 
and again. In time, a natural self-protection arises and the child's 
love is qualified with caution.
A person learns that when he loves, he is unprotected; love 
destroys his self-protection and makes him vulnerable to 
suffering. With each year of worldly experience, additional self-
protective factors come into one's life. Ambition, business cares, 
competition, gratification of the senses, greed, resentment, 
hatred, jealousy — the whole range of narrowing tendencies 
exert more and more influence on body, mind, heart, and 
intelligence. The open, natural heart-expansion of early 
childhood is by now a thing of the past.
Is not this obstruction of the flow of love a fundamental reason 
why the life of an older person is often dry and joyless?
In this modern society, a dry and joyless life is the general 
experience. Witness the frantic search for distraction and pleasure 
the world over. An almost universal prayer arises from adult per-
sons caught up in today's culture: "0 Lord, may there be a new 
season of Spring in my heart. May the river of Love flow deep and 
strong again in my heart."
Here, to me, is one of the most wonderful miracles of Sri Sathya 
Sai Baba. The fettered heart, turning to Baba, can break free from 
all its bondage. Seeing him, being sure that he will never betray, 
is a most wonderful feeling. With joy, the heart responds to this 
trust. With each day, love for Baba grows stronger. He is divine 
Mother and Father to his devotee. One may love him without 
reserve, without guard, without fear, however guarded one may 
still be with fellow human beings. Of course, one's outward 
behavior with him must remain strictly disciplined.
