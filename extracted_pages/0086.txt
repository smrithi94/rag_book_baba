BABA'S TEACHINGS 69
The pure spontaneous love that was oneself as a little child has not 
been destroyed and taken from us by the world; it is obscured only 
by Maya, by our worldliness. The shadow of the world will not 
remain, if we give heart and mind to Baba and to his divine 
teachings.
Let Me tell you one thing: However you are, you are Mine. I 
will not give you up. Wherever you are, you are near Me; you 
cannot go beyond My Reach.
— Sathya Sai Baba
