ferent boats!" In this same context, Baba once remarked, "First 
there must be common sense, then comes Divine Sense."
Baba's advice as to how we may lead a spiritual life is revealed by 
him in clear words in his teachings. We need not yield to doubt and 
misunderstanding. Baba says in plain words how to conduct our 
lives, and he is ever available as the Inner Voice of conscience, if 
and when we are in trouble and doubt.
The age span 16-30 is crucial, for that is the period when life 
adds sweetness to itself, when talents, skills, and attitudes are 
accumulated, sublimated, and sanctified. If the tonic of unselfish 
service is administered to the mind during this period, life's 
mission is fulfilled — for the process of sublimation and 
sanctification will be hastened by this tonic. Do not serve for the 
sake of reward, attracting attention, or earning gratitude, or 
from a sense of pride at your own superiority in skill, wealth, 
status, or authority. Serve because you are urged by Love. When 
you succeed, ascribe the success to the Grace of God who urged 
you on, as Love within you. When you fail, ascribe the failure to 
your own inadequacy, insincerity, or ignorance.
— Sathya Sai Baba
