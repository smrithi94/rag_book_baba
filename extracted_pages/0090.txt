God, Himself, Is the
Only Reliable Guru
We complain that we do not actually experience divine bliss as a 
constant of our daily life even though divine bliss is said to be the 
truth of oneself. Baba acknowledges this difficulty and says that 
ignorance of self, of one's true nature is almost universal. He says 
that just as a person who is caught in quicksand is best helped by 
another person who is on firm ground, the individual who longs for 
happiness is best helped by one who is himself firmly established 
in ever-constant divine bliss. The one who is able to help is named 
the Guru, in the tradition of India.
Baba goes on to inform us that in this age, which is marked by a 
deterioration of self-discipline and righteous behavior, God, 
Himself, is the only reliable Guru and, if appealed to, God will 
answer from within the heart of the devotee, or will cause an em-
bodied guru to appear in the devotee's world. If called upon, God 
will lovingly guide the devotee.
That Baba does indeed guide his devotees is my own constant 
experience. How can I describe the course of my life with Baba? 
Perhaps a start could be made by mentioning some of the ways in 
which Baba is found to be unique, at least within the limits of my 
own life-experience.
Baba demonstrates again and again that nothing is concealed
