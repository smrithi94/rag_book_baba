BABA'S TEACHINGS 81
self-proclaimed "I," under intense scrutiny, will yield to the subtle 
reality which is its ground. But now words are no longer meaning-
ful, any attempt at description would be false. From this point, each 
of us must go alone, naked of ideas and words.
In Baba's divine teaching, he again and again tells us the practice 
of self-inquiry is vital to spiritual life. Self-inquiry is the flash of 
total consciousness. Its practice can be engaged in at any time. 
People engage in self-inquiry in order to realize the truth of Self 
once and for all, and thus be free of doubt. No philosopher, or sage 
or writer claims credit for discovering self-inquiry. Just as small 
creatures arise spontaneously within a mass of rotting flesh, self-
inquiry arises spontaneously within the pain of human sorrow. The 
modes of self-inquiry are as varied as the individuals within whom 
the urge to inquire arises. The text and chapter of self-inquiry is 
more easily come upon in the East than in the West, but the urge 
to know what one naturally is, stripped naked of all that can be 
discarded, is strong and alive to inquiring minds the world over.
Remember that with every step, you are nearing God, and, God, 
too, when you take one step towards Him, takes ten towards 
you. There is no stopping place in this pilgrimage; it is one 
continuous journey, through day and night, through valley and 
desert, through tears and smiles, through death and birth, 
through tomb and womb. When the road ends, and the Goal is 
gained, the pilgrim finds that he has travelled only from himself 
to himself, that the way was long and lonesome, but, the God 
that led him unto, was all the while in him, around him, with 
him, and beside him!
