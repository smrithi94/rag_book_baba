Karma
In India, people use the word "Karma" when referring to an action 
which will not be complete until its energy has been totally 
expended in the consequences of that action. Baba informs us that 
the impending consequences of an action in innumerable past lives 
is an enormous karmic force. He says that our present birth came 
about because of that karmic force and, until we can get free from 
the entangling web of action and reaction, our karmic destiny will 
continue through aeons of time, until eventually, we do get free.
Our world is afloat on a vast sea of information, but information is 
raw data only; it is the distillation of that information which yields 
knowledge. In the most ancient of times, the distillation of 
information by saints and sages yielded a supreme elixir of knowl-
edge about human life; the knowledge of how to free oneself from 
the endless turning of the wheel of action and reaction. For, until 
that was done, one could not know what was contrived, transient, 
and therefore, unreal; and what was uncontrived, eternal, and real. 
As it was in the past, so it is now: the only knowledge worthy of the 
name is that elixir of knowledge of how to escape from the prison of 
action and consequence. Without this, the information we gather 
each day, is an ocean into which we are sinking, and in which we 
will die, as ignorant and helpless in death as we were at birth.
