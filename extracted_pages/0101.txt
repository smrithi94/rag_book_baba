84 MY BABA AND I
however, that when the empirical self — the person, the ego — sur-
renders to God in the final moment of Self-Realization, all karma is 
transcended. The body of the liberated one may continue to live out 
the life-span and act like other people; but consciousness, which in 
the moment of liberation abandons its particularity, no longer 
identifies with the body. There is unimpaired freedom at that 
moment. This should not be taken to imply, however, that there is 
no way-station between the full suffering of karmic consequence 
and full release at the moment of God-Realization. If, in devotion to 
Him, we dedicate our life to God, praying that His Will be done, He 
softens the due consequence of our past actions. Inconveniences 
there will be, "accidents" and illness there will be, but major 
disasters do not touch us. This is the long-term experience of Sai 
devotees. Baba explains it in terms of medicine stored in the 
medicine cabinet. The consequence of our action is the medicine. 
Everything changes, in time, in this manifest world, and, in time, 
the potency of the medicine stored in the cabinet is reduced and 
does not have its full impact, even though we eventually take it. 
For his devotees, for those persons surrendered to God's Will, Baba 
"ages" the medicine of karmic consequence, and thus softens its 
impact.
To the question, "May we know total freedom from all karma?," 
Baba's answer is "Yes." Total freedom from ignorance and untruth 
about oneself, grants freedom from all karma. That divine freedom 
is at hand for us; let us be wise and accept it.
