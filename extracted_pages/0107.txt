90 MY BABA AND I
Yielding the feeling and the claim "I am acting" to God, who is the 
source of man and world and hence is the true Actor, we can accept 
whatever comes to us as His Will, no longer making distinctions 
such as "I want" or "I do not want." Baba puts it very simply when 
he says, "The road to happiness lies not in doing what you like, but 
in liking what you must do."
Detachment is possible, and it is the way of Release. Baba assures 
us that while the beginning of rebirth cannot be perceived, yet it can 
come to an end. Further, Baba says that in this very lifetime rebirth 
may come to an ending.
Baba's use of the word, "Release," is identical with the use of such 
terms as God-Realization, Self-Realization, Enlightenment, 
Liberation, Freedom from Bondage, Freedom from Birth and 
Death. Baba describes "Liberation" as follows: "When the entire 
creation in and around him becomes a blissful love and light-
emitting experience, then the Sadhaka loses the limited conscious-
ness of his individual entity, transcends the peripheries of person-
ality to experience at all times through all his senses the Blissful 
Immanent Divinity which was always latent in himself."
Life is a pilgrimage, where man drags his feet along the rough 
and thorny road. With the Name of God on his lips, he will 
have no thirst; with the Form of God in his heart, he will feel 
no exhaustion. The company of the holy will inspire him to 
travel in hope and faith. The assurance that God is within call, 
that He is ever near, nor is He long in corning, will lend 
strength to his limbs and courage to his eye.
