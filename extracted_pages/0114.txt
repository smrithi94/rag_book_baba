BABA'S TEACHINGS 97
Q: So your objective can be summed up as a brotherhood 
of humanity to be achieved through the doctrine of love?
BABA: Yes, what else can save the world from 
thermonuclear fires? Everything points to the terror of 
that conflagration coming; and my mission is to pre-
empt the fires by reestablishing Dharma and the 
spiritual law of one God, one Religion, one Language 
embracing one Humanity.
I preach only one religion of love for all, which alone can 
integrate the human race into a brotherhood of man under 
the fatherhood of God. I know only one language — of 
the heart — beyond the mind or intellect relating man to 
man and mankind to God, thereby creating mutual 
understanding, cooperation, and community life in peace 
and harmony. On this basis I want to build one humanity 
without any religious, caste, or other barriers in a 
universal empire of love which could enable my devotees 
to feel the whole world as their own family.
Q:
Well said, Baba — but wouldn't this dharma
with its Hindu orientation conflict with the established 
religions?
BABA: No, it will not do anything of the kind because my 
objective is the establishment of Sanathana Dharma which 
believes in one God as propitiated by the founders of all 
religions. So none has to give up his religion or deity, but 
through them worship the one God in all. I have come not 
to disturb or destroy but to confirm and vindicate 
everyone in his own faith.
Q: But how will that prevent a nuclear holocaust?
BABA:
By removing all causes, sources,
barriers,and provocations of class, caste, creed, colour, 
and race, and replacing the existing hate and violence with 
love and nonviolence. I expect to provide humanity with 
an evangel of peaceful cooperation to replace the present 
escalation to death by co-destruction.
R. K. Karanjia: Thank you, Swamiji. I am all the more 
grateful to You because I really did not expect You to 
answer the whole long list of my questions.
