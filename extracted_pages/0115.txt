98 MY BABA AND I
In the course of his discussion with Sri Karanjia, Baba informed 
us that although His hand may not be visible, the Divine does 
intervene at certain times in the affairs of men and, further, the 
Divine also intervenes before the event to keep mankind from 
totally destroying man and other life forms as well. Baba further 
pointed out that if the Divine were to bring all suffering and ine-
quality to an immediate halt, the same conditions would quickly 
arise again, and that a permanent change can take place only when 
mankind raises its consciousness to a higher level than is now the 
case.
The child has its tongue and the mother has hers. The mother 
keeps the child on her lap and pronounces the words so that the 
child may learn to speak. However busy the mother's tongue 
may be, the child has to speak through its own tongue. The 
mother cannot speak for the child and save herself all the 
bother! The Guru, too, is like that. He can only repeat, remind, 
inspire, instruct, persuade, plead; the activity, the disciple must 
himself initiate. He must jump over the stile himself. No one can 
hoist him over it!
