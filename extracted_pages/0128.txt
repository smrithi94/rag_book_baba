Our Pure Mind
The word "mind" and its adjective "pure" are verbal symbols 
which represent something of a certain quality, but neither of the 
two refer to anything which can be measured and thus given a 
standard definition to which everyone could turn. When we talk 
about a pure mind, we are speaking of that which is subjective, and 
we cannot be sure that we all attach the same meaning to those 
words. Yet, something real is meant.
How can we agree as to what is meant by a pure mind? Our 
options are not many. We can study what great seers and sages 
say. We could get a number of opinions from a variety of people 
and try to arrive at a common denominator. Or, we can make the 
assumption that really we know what we are talking about when 
we refer to a pure mind, even though it is subjective and not 
measured or precise.
Would we agree that an agitated mind is not what is meant by a pure 
mind? I believe we would agree. Suppose there is a mind of which 
we become aware because of a flow of clear, precise, logical 
thinking. We might admire such a mind, but I doubt if that is what 
we mean by a pure mind. How about the quality of thoughts as a 
determinant of a pure mind? That some thoughts are impure almost 
everyone would agree. But not all thoughts are impure.
