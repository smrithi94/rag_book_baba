116 MY BABA AND I
direct personal experience in this field of the pure mind, so that we 
may shift our awareness from a theoretical base to a vital and alive 
experiential base. If this could be accomplished, it would seem that 
our vitality could be gathered into intense, one-pointed attention to 
the subjective depths of ourselves. Into that poised alertness there 
might flash the realization of ourselves as the divine, pure, silent 
mind. "Purity is Enlightenment" declares Sai.
It would be good to, once again, turn to Sai and ask how we might 
gain a direct, initial experience in this field of the pure mind. To the 
writer, at least, it is evident that Sri Sathya Sai has already pointed a 
way whereby we may gain an initial experience which will, in turn, 
make the field of the pure mind real to us. The way was revealed by 
Sai when he said, "Who are you? Sorrows will never cease until 
you know the answer to this question." Sai placed within our hands 
a light which we may use without depending on anyone whosoever 
in this world or in its heavens, a light which can quickly reveal the 
fact of a pure, silent, mind which knows directly without the 
movement of thought, or notions of self. We need only turn to the 
feeling of self, of which we are ever aware, concentrate our full 
vigilant attention there, not in a hard way, but softly. Most surely 
there will follow that initial experience which we need, and 
thereafter our life will never again be the same.
