Surrender to the Lord
Baba tells his devotees that he is the actual resident of each heart, and 
if called upon, he is quite willing to guide our life to its glorious 
fulfillment. A glorious fulfillment of life is certainly what each 
person wants. We want, and Baba is willing. Why then does not 
everything immediately fit together?
If the matter were as simple as it seems to be at first glance, we 
would be in a happy state. That it is not so easy to grasp, is 
demonstrated by the endless discussions and questions about the 
topic of surrender to the Divine which arise whenever devotees get 
together at Sai Retreats and round table discussions. If Baba is to 
take over responsibility for the course of our lives, we obviously 
need to surrender our lives to him and let him be the charioteer. 
About this, the God-Realized saint, Sri Ramakrishna said, "For a 
devotee, there is no path safer and smoother than that of the `
Power of Attorney.' This means resigning the self to the will of the 
Almighty, to have no consciousness that anything is 'mine.' If one 
acquires the conviction that everything is done by God's Will, then 
one becomes an instrument in the hands of the Lord, and one is 
free even in this life. He who can resign himself to the will of the 
Almighty with simple faith and guileless love realizes God very 
quickly."
