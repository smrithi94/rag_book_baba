120 MY BABA AND I
deny the sun. Before long, a breeze comes into being and sweeps the 
dark clouds away. In our case, Baba's divine teachings will sweep 
away the dark clouds of thoughts and concepts and bitter feelings 
which obscure and seemingly deny the fullness of our love.
So, let us put aside worry, doubt, and protest and begin this day to 
love God with all our heart. Let us this very day begin full 
surrender to the wisdom and guidance of the Divine and know that 
He, not ourselves, is the Doer.
Motherhood is the most precious gift of God. Mothers are the 
makers of a nation's fortune or misfortune, for they shape the 
sinews of its soul. Those sinews are toughened by two lessons 
they should teach: fear of sin, and fondness for virtue. Both 
these are based on faith in God being the inner motivator of all. 
If you want to know how advanced a nation is, study the 
mothers: are they free from fear and anxiety, are they full of 
Love towards all, are they trained in fortitude and virtue? If 
you like to imbibe the glory of a culture, watch the mothers, 
rocking the cradles, feeding, fostering, teaching, and fondling 
the babies. As the mother, so the progress of the nation; as the 
mother, so the sweetness of the culture.
— Sathya Sai Baba
