BABA'S TEACHINGS 123
that the universe is really nothing. Have faith. Faith is precedent for 
a seeker of truth."
We know that for real knowledge, experience is necessary. 
Disciplined concepts and ideas are good as far as they go, but there is 
a difference when we directly know that which is the basis for the 
concepts and ideas. Until there is direct experience, one's 
understanding is not really clear. In a recent (1984) conversation, I 
asked Baba about the world as a creation of the mind. I said, "A 
source of confusion is about everything being a creation of the mind. 
A creation of whose mind?"
SAI: It is the mind.
JH: But Swami, how could that be? Is my mind creating 
the war and all its horrors? I do not find such actions in 
myself!
SAI: When you think of the world, it exists for you. When 
you do not think of it, it does not exist.
JH: When I do not think of the world, it is not in my 
consciousness! Does the war exist only according to my 
consciousness of it? But there was a beginning to it. How 
could that beginning be due only to my mind?
SAI: At your stage, it will not be possible to grasp this. 
As long as the mind exists, it is not possible to com-
prehend the mind and its activity clearly. When 
thoughts cease there will be no mind. Mind is a bundle 
of thoughts. Do not follow the thought. Then the world 
will not develop for you. Now your thoughts have gone 
to America, to problems there. But these are just 
thoughts. If you now follow these thoughts and go to 
America, they will bring about the world for you.
JH: Does Swami mean that one should just be a witness to 
the thoughts going through one's mind and not do anything 
about them?
SAI: Exactly. When the mind is destroyed (i.e. when 
there is direct seeing without an intervening thought 
process), then the coming into being of the world will be 
clear to you. There is only God, God only. Hold to Him. 
Hold closely to Him, and the matter of the mind will be 
resolved.
