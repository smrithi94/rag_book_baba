132 MY BABA AND I
God, that we also are God, and that the only difference between 
him and ourselves is that he is ever aware of, and lives fully in his 
truth, whereas we are unaware of our truth. He says that our 
unawareness persists mainly because we are not intensely inter-
ested. Our attention is divided, and nobody in whom we have 
strong faith has ever told us that in spite of all appearances to the 
contrary, we are essentially divine and may come to know our 
essential divinity if we are intense and earnest about it.
Baba's teaching is a direct statement of his life. He is like a man 
who holds a pearl in the palm of his hand in a good light and 
directly weighs what is there. What Baba teaches us is fully self-
evident to him; no prior learning is needed. He knows without 
learning.
Those who teach about Nature and its laws, matter and its 
properties, forces and their pulls, teach to bind, not to liberate. 
It is a burden, not bliss. It provides a stone boat for you to cross 
the sea with waves of grief and crests of joy. It cannot float you 
along; it is certain to sink. What you need to cross the sea is the 
bark of bhakthi*, of assurance of Grace, of surrender to His 
will. Throw off all burdens, become light, and you can trip 
across with one step on one crest and another on the next. God 
will take you through. You have no need to bother at all. For, 
when He does everything, who is concerned about what?
— Sathya Sai Baba
* — Devotion, dedication, the path of love to God.
