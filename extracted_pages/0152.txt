longer in duration rather than fast and short as is the case when we 
are agitated.
The spiritual practice of sitting quietly and allowing one's breathing 
to become slow and even is named "Ekaantha Bhakthi." Baba 
describes the practice as follows:
Ekaantha Bhakthi is a subtle thing achieved by effective 
control of the mind and experiencing one's Self. It is not 
correct to think that control of the mind means holding it 
steady without wandering around. To be able to cleanse 
the mind of impure thoughts is the correct meaning of 
Ekaantha. This is to be practiced in a quiet place free 
from noise or disturbance. The best time for practice is 
during the hours 3 a.m. to 5 a.m. Select a particular time 
in this period, close the door, sit quietly, and adjust the 
breath so that the rate of inhaling and exhaling is the 
same. This is important. And, further, by gradual 
practice, the number of breathings per minute must be 
reduced from eight or ten a minute to two or one a 
minute. You have to take your own time, proceeding 
gradually in the process of reduction of the number of 
times of inhaling and exhaling. To control the breath in 
this manner, there is a very effective discipline that 
should be followed: the tip of the tongue must be made 
gently to touch the rear of the teeth. When it is kept in 
this specific position, the thoughts in the mind become 
less, you detach yourself from thoughts of the body and 
things around you and you come to the stage of Ekaan-
tha Bhakthi. Ekaatha Bhakthi is that state of mind 
without thoughts and desires when it is concentrated on 
God.
