Our Discontent
Is it not true of ourselves that most of us spend our lives seeking to 
calm and satisfy our discontent? We cannot take whatever comes 
and be perfectly happy with it. If we are left solitary and lonely 
without any distraction, we become discontented and in time we 
seek experience. If our experience does not fully satisfy us, we 
strive to bring about a change. But full and complete satisfaction is 
not ours even with radical change.
Why is it that discontent has such a vitality that it continues to arise 
no matter what we do? There must be some situation which is very 
general and very much alive for discontent to be so general and so 
alive. But, everybody experiences discontent, and therefore 
everyone, if he chooses to look, may see the fundamental causes of 
discontent. For example: Is there not in everyone the thought that 
he is going to die? His philosophy may prepare him for death, but 
not at this very second, please! Our discontent when life is 
threatened is universally known.
Also, is our thirst for knowledge ever satisfied? From the housewife 
who inquires about the affairs of her friends and her family, to the 
businessman seeking to know his industry, to the saint thirsting 
after God, we strive to know more and more; and until we have 
perfect knowledge, our discontent will not be eased.
