Creation
Very likely every person, at some time or other, looks at the 
universe and at himself or herself and wonders, "How did all this 
come about, and why?"
The various religions put forward explanations about creation, and 
so do scientists and philosophers. At times, educational authorities 
adopt one theory of creation and make its teaching mandatory in the 
schools of the nation.
Perhaps the mind can truly understand creation, and perhaps it cannot. 
In any event, what Baba has to say about creation maybe of interest. 
Baba declares, "See in me, yourself, for, I see myself in you. You are 
my life, my breath, my soul. You are all my forms. When I love you I 
love myself; when you love yourself, you love me. I separated myself 
by myself so that I may be myself. I separated myself from myself and 
became all this so that I may be myself. I wanted to be myself, that is, 
Anandaswarupa, Premaswarupa. That is what I am and I wanted to be 
that. How can I be Anandaswarupa and Premaswarupa? And give 
Ananda and give Prema? And to whom am I to give Ananda and to 
whom am Ito give Prema? So I did this. I separated myself from myself 
and became all this."1
1. "Prema" is the limitless Divine Love. "Ananda" is the limitless Divine Bliss. "
Premaswarupa" and "Anandaswarupa" are the embodiment of the Divine Love and
Divine Bliss.
