The Will, Free or Not?
A topic which is always sure to spark divergent opinions is that of

who help themselves. This implies that we have free will and 
therefore the obligation to act according to our perception of what 
is correct action, and that we are responsible for the result of our 
action. Then there is the burning debate of freedom itself. Are we

net effect of the multitude of diverse influences bearing upon it? Or, 
are we free souls, freely choosing our role in life and able to modify

choose inaction vs. action according to our resolve? Or, is the 
condition one of mixed freedom and non-freedom? Is it that at
