BABA'S TEACHINGS 147
cost to us if we do this, and the benefit may be great indeed. The 
poet devotee of Ramana Maharshi, Sri Muruganar, sang: (
translated)
The substance and power of full
Surrender is but this state of `mouna,'
Where by inquiring who this 'I' is
Who this ego false, one dies
And merges in the Being true
Of God impersonal, the Self.
The Lord controls the doer till 
The fruits of former action are 
Exhausted; until then no effort 
Can change the course of things
ordained,
`Tis wisdom then to rest in `mouna.'
None can oppose what is ordained
by God omnipotent. `Tis wisdom
Then for the false, weak, villainous
mind
To cast off every care and rest
In `mouna' at His feet.
In the midst of all the varying concepts about free will, Baba offers 
his devotees some firm advice. He says that love cannot be 
disregarded. That above all concepts there is the reality of love, 
and that love is the royal highway to Self-Realization. He says that 
we will find it to be best if we do not take on the burden of 
intellectual argumentation, but instead do service for less 
fortunate people, live in devotion to God and be sure that thought, 
word, and action are in harmony.
God Himself will prompt our action. He is then the doer of the 
action, we are no longer the doer and the question of free will does 
not arise. This is a principal teaching of Baba's. If we love God 
and dedicate every action to Him, He will accept the consequence 
of the action and the devotee need have no concern about free will 
or no free will.
