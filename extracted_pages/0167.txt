150 MY BABA AND I
to whom we tend to feel superior in the ordinary course of events.
An objection might be raised that such actions of service as have 
been described are fit for young and mobile bodies, but what about 
those old, sick, and handicapped people who are also devotees of 
Baba? There is no need for any doubt. Baba says that if we cannot 
actively help, we can certainly refrain from working harm upon 
anyone. He says that the very foundation for help to others is the 
ground of never doing harm to others. Do not underestimate this 
declaration. Is it not true that day by day, the world over, screams 
of anguish rise to the heavens from people who are being 
mistreated, abused, tortured, and killed by other human beings? 
Just suppose that now, this very hour, there were a total cessation of 
people working harm upon other people. Would that not be the 
greatest, the most extraordinary, the most glorious day of man in 
the history of our troubled world?
Devotees of able body can engage in service to the unfortunate, 
and those not able-bodied can totally desist from working harm 
upon others. Who is to say which is better than the other? Both 
consist of service to God, to humanity, and to oneself.
Make your heart soft, then success is quick in Sadhana (
spiritual practice). Talk softly, talk sweetly, talk only of God — 
that is the process of softening the subsoil. Develop 
compassion, sympathy; engage in service, understand the agony 
of poverty and disease, distress and despair; share both tears 
and cheers with others. That is the way to soften the heart and 
help Sadhana to succeed.
— Sathya Sai Baba
