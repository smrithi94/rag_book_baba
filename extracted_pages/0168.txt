Our Experience with Happiness
Individuals occasionally say they are already happy and have no need 
of Baba's teachings. Happiness is indeed experienced by almost 
everyone for varying lengths of time. Baba says that were it not for a 
current of happiness from our Self finding its way into our worldly 
life, life would be quite intolerable and we could not bear it.
Baba further points out that a present happiness which is due to 
happy circumstances may change to sorrow because of sorrowful 
circumstances. He informs us, "No object that is accessible to the 
senses can give man undiluted, permanent bliss. The charm of an 
individual person is not exempt from this rule. The ever-beautiful 
Lord alone can award the ever-available bliss, the eternal Truth of 
God. The eternal source of joy is also God."
There is a simile which Baba uses in this context. A dog finds a dry 
bone, bites it and chews it and finds it enjoyable. The rough bone 
has cut the tender inner surface of the dog's mouth and some 
bleeding results. What the dog is tasting and enjoying is its own 
blood, not the dry bone. The dog believes that happiness is in the 
bone, and will continue to chew dry bones wherever they are 
found. The dog is not able to pierce the illusion that dry old bones 
have a wonderful taste, and the dog can never know the truth of the 
matter. But we humans, according to Baba, can pierce illusion
