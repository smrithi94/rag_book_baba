Ceiling on Desires
In a recent discourse, Baba once again mentioned that if we aim to 
live a spiritual life, it is essential to limit desires and to help humanity 
by serving people who are in need. Baba said in part, "Selfless 
activity is the hallmark of a person who has equanimity of purpose. 
Therefore, today, the primary injunction being given to you is to love 
all living forms and beings in order to secure the grace of God in your 
daily work. Therefore, we have this four-fold ceiling on desires. We 
should not waste food; eat what you really need, thereby, you are 
doing service. Do not waste the faculties given to you. In order that 
we might save some money, try to curb your expenditures. There are 
many wealthy people who, on occasions of marriage and so on, spend 
thousands of rupees. In this process, what do they do? They give to 
those who are already wealthy. You should give to those who do not 
have any money. Misuse of money is evil. Therefore, do not waste 
food, time, money, or energy. When you are no longer wasteful, you 
will be able to do any amount of service."
Does the above statement by Baba represent the totality of what he 
means by a Ceiling on Desires? Baba says further, "As a fish is 
very fond of living in water, just so is man fond of living on the 
basis of satisfying desires. In the circumstances, a great effort is 
needed to give up the old habits of living by satisfying desires."
