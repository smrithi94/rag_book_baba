Pandora's Box
Pandora's Box, once opened, brings forth a multitude of unexpected 
troubles. A simple and almost universal human trait could be likened 
to the cover of Pandora's Box. It is a trait which Baba speaks of 
continually, for beneath it lurks a very great danger which can result 
in the destruction of one's chance to have a meaningful and liberating 
life.
The human trait mentioned is the wide-spread tendency to find fault 
with others. Other people are often faulty indeed, and our indignation 
at their misdeeds is almost irresistible in its urge to be expressed in 
words, if not in action. By itself, on the surface, finding fault with 
others is damaging enough. It poisons relationships, scuttles the self-
confidence of the victims, and brings about a set of circumstances 
which most assuredly do not contribute to our own happiness. But 
these are the least of the evils which spring forth when Pandora's Box 
is opened.
Baba points out that when we yield to the tendency to find, talk 
about, and dwell on the faults of other people two serious mis-
fortunes are visited upon us: (a) the coarse flow of fault-finding 
disrupts the subtle flow of self-inquiry and, (b) one's attention is 
directed outward to the faults of other people and with this mindset 
one is unable to realize one's Divinity.
