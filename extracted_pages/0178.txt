BABA'S TEACHINGS 161
Divine heritage. Thus, finding fault with others has the terrible effect 
of blocking our consciousness from its potential of abiding at the 
level of Divinity.
It is for these reasons that Baba teaches that we should keep Pandora'
s Box closed upon this extremely damaging practice.
Baba says to his devotees, "What I want you to resolve from today is: 
do not find fault in others. Do not scandalize anyone. Do not feel 
envious or be malicious. Be always sweet in temperament and in 
your talk. Fill your conversation with devotion and humility."
The foundation for real peace is, according to the Vedas, the 
quality of My Three. My Three means amicability, compassion, 
kindness. It can also be taken to mean "my three," that is to 
say, my word, deed, and thought shall be in accordance with 
thy word, thought, and deed. That is to say, we shall speak, 
think and act together, without friction or faction, in the 
atmosphere of love and understanding. That is what is wanted 
in the world today, My Three.
— Sathya Sai Baba
