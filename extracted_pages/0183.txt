Our Body
Baba tells us, "To realize his nature, which is Divine, man has to by-
pass the human body which is the base for his 'I' personality."
For ages past, individuals have attempted to transcend the limitation 
of their bodies. Some have regarded the body as an almost literal 
prison and have tried to escape by austerities, denial of food and 
sleep, and by using the hammer blows of weather extremes, icy 
streams, and unnatural postures. But Baba advises, "The body has 
to be carefully and tenderly fostered. It is a precious gift, a very 
complicated but well-coordinated machine, given for achieving a 
laudable task." Baba himself is the example. He is freedom itself, 
yet we may note that his care for his body is easy and natural. Even 
the Buddha, whose austerities were the wonder of yogis throughout 
the India of his day, realized the futility of abusing his body and, 
thereafter, gave conventional care to his body. He gained Liberation 
after choosing the middle way between austerity and sensory 
indulgence.
Baba tells us that, in fact, body is solidified mind, and then goes on 
to say, "To think that somehow we got this human body more as an 
accident than for a purpose and to think we should feed it with all the 
pleasures and then let it wither away and die is a great mistake. It is 
not proper to spend our life in such a thoughtless manner."
