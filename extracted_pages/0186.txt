Seva 
Baba teaches that service to others is esential to spiritual life. He 
gives two clear directives. The first and basic service is to arrange 
our lives so that we are not engaged in working harm upon anyone, 
including ourselves. The wisdom of this is self-evident and everyone 
from the young to the aged has it in his or her power to adopt this 
first principle of service.
Baba's second teaching about service is to serve God in oneself and 
in others. He points out that while a formless God is not an object 
to Whom we can render service; yet God is the ever-present 
Resident in each and every heart, and we may joyfully worship and 
serve Him there. He tells us, "Everyone wants love, happiness, 
ananda from me. So, each one must offer unto my Immanence — 
manifest as my creatures — the same love, happiness, and ananda 
that he or she seeks from me."
Because we are under social pressure to engage in service, we may 
tend to do service as a social or cultural responsibility. This can lead 
to the error of doing what someone else tells us to do without 
thinking it through for ourselves. Baba reminds us, "Compassion 
without wisdom is as disastrous as wisdom without compassion." 
Prior to engaging in service actions, it is good to look inward to 
conscience and test the proposed service action in the light
