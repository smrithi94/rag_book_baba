BABA'S TEACHINGS 171
manifestations of my Immanence, then in fulfillment of my role as 
Sathya Sai, I descend to help, accompany, and carry that yogee. I am 
always near such a yogee to guide him and to shower my love on his 
life."
We are warned most emphatically of the deadly danger of 
selfishness. Yet, of itself, service to others is of deep and far-
reaching benefit to ourselves. It has a profound influence on one's 
destiny. About this, Baba says, "Only human beings are blessed 
with the abilities to acquire the powers of supra-human beings, 
and even to surpass them, to attain Divinity earlier through 
selfless service and dedication to the divine purpose, and through 
surrender and dependence on the Divine Will."
Service in all its forms, all the world over, is primarily spiritual 
discipline — mental clean-up! Without the inspiration given by 
that attitude, the urge is bound to ebb and grow dry, or, it may 
meander into pride and pomp. Just think for a moment: Are you 
serving God? Or, is God serving you? . . . When you offer milk 
to a hungry child, or a blanket to a shivering brother on the 
pavement, you are but placing a gift of God into the hands of 
another gift of God! You are reposing the gift of God in a 
repository of the Divine Principle! God serves; He allows you to 
claim that you have served! Without His Will, no single blade of 
grass can quiver in the breeze. Fill every moment with gratitude 
to the Giver and the Recipient of all gifts.
