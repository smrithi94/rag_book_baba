Holding to Truth
Baba often puzzles people by telling them they are divine, whereas 
they know very well from a lifetime of mistakes and other 
experiences that they are only too human. Such statements by Baba 
introduce the spiritual practice of Holding to Truth. Baba declares, 
"Do not think that you are human and that you have to reach the 
state of the Divine. Think rather that you are God, and that from 
that state you have become a human being. If you think this way, 
all the attributes of God will manifest in you. Know that you have 
descended from God as human beings and that eventually you will 
go back to your source."
If our minds hold to the idea that a certain faulty human person is 
oneself then that is where our consciousness will be, and it is that 
concept which will guide our life. Whereas, if our mind holds to the 
idea that the Divine is us and we are the Divine, that is where our 
consciousness will reside. Long ago, the sage Annamacharya said, "
How much you think you are, so much, not more are you." And, 
centuries ago, the Self-Realized sage, the 14 year-old Asta-vakra, 
guru of King Janaka, said to him, "In our present condition, we are 
not in our own Self. We are conscious only of the body and the 
mind and all the various things of the world. Wherever our con-
sciousness is, there we are." Today, the Avathar of the Age,
