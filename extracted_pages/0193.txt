176 MY BABA AND I
we lose by doing as Baba teaches? And everything may be lost if 
we do not!
This is the spiritual practice of Holding to Truth, which Baba says 
will bring us to realize that we are the Divine. Do not equate his 
teaching with "Mesmerism" or "Positive Thinking." What Baba 
teaches is no modern fad. Centuries ago, in the ecstasy of Self-Reali-
zation, King Janaka declared to his guru, "I am pure consciousness. 
Through ignorance I have imposed limitations upon myself. Con-
stantly reflecting in this way, I am abiding in the Absolute."
In an almighty revelation, cutting away the very ground of 
ignorance where until now we have taken our stand, Baba gave the 
spiritual practice of Holding to Truth as part of his Birthday Dis-
course, November 23, 1983. He said,
If your yearning to experience Brahmananda, the
Sath-Chith-Ananda, is sincere and pure, from this day, 
keep ever in your memory what I am about to tell you:'
(1) "I am God; I am not different from God." Be
conscious of this always. Keep it ever in mind. "I am
God; I am God, I am not different from God." Be
reminding yourself of this. Pray that you may not fail in
this spiritual exercise.
(2) "I am the Indivisible Supreme Absolute." This is
the second Truth to be established in the con-
sciousness by unremitting repetition and prayer.
(3) "I am Sath-Chith-Ananda." (i.e. Being, Awareness,
Bliss).
(4) "Grief and anxiety can never affect me." Develop this
faith and convince yourselves of this Truth by repeated
assurance and prayer.
(5) "I am ever content; fear can never enter me." Feel
thus for ever. Pray that this conviction grows stronger
and stronger.
As the physical body is maintained healthy and strong by
the five vital airs (prana), these five prayers will endow
you with the 'awareness of Brahman' which is the same
as 'the status of Brahman Itself!
1. Brahmananda and Sath-Chith-Ananda mean the supreme Being, Conscious-
ness, and Bliss of Divinity
