Blessings to American Members
of the Sai Family
. . . Love is vital. Love is Divine. To render an act fit to be offered 
to God and pure enough to win His Grace, it has to be a 
manifestation of Love. The brighter the manifestation, the nearer 
you are to God. Prema (Divine Love) is not affected or modified 
by considerations of caste, or creed, or religion; it cannot be tar-
nished by envy, malice or hate . . . Fill every word of yours with 
Love, fill every act of yours with Love. The word that emerges 
from your tongue shall not stab like the knife, nor wound like the 
arrow, nor hit like the hammer. It has to be a fountain of sweet 
nectar, a counsel of consoling vedantic wisdom, a soft path of 
blossoms. It must shower peace and joy . . . Love knows no fear. 
Love shuns falsehood. Fear drags man into falsehood, injustice, 
and wrong. Love does not crave for praise; that is its strength. On-
ly those who have no Love in them itch for reward and reputation. 
The reward for Love is Love itself.
When you are eager to place offerings before the Lord, instead 
of transitory materials, let your offering be Love. Love is the 
very Light of Life; it is the only comprehensive Code of Conduct 
. . . Let it flow clear from the heart, as a stream of Truth, a river 
of wisdom. Let it not emanate from the head, nor from the 
tongue. Let it emerge, full and free, from the heart. This is the 
highest duty, the noblest Godliness.
Start the day with Love. Live the day with Love. Fill the day with 
Love. Spend the day with Love. End the day with Love. This is the 
way to God.
