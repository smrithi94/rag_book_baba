Baba Talks to the Indian Air Force
Dec. 5, 1982
(written down after the talk)
"Man's natural state is happiness, and he cannot be blamed for 
craving that which is his own. But man is making a serious mistake. 
He believes that the happiness for which he craves comes from 
objects which he can experience. The truth of the matter is that he 
does not experience these objects. On the contrary, the objects 
experience the man, and in this process the man is further 
weakened. The man comes home from his work feeling tired and 
frustrated. In order to seek relaxation and a renewal of a feeling of 
happiness, the man goes to a cimema and gets his mind filled with 
faulty life values portrayed by the glamorous actors and actresses. 
Or, the man goes off to his club. There he engages in conversation 
about the world, perhaps plays cards, and perhaps takes liquor. This 
is all a waste of time; and waste of time is waste of life. Instead of 
renewing the man's strength, it further weakens him.
"What is the remedy? The remedy is to consider the truth which 
represents this ancient and sacred land of Bharat. The eternal truth 
is that there is only one ever-lasting, never-failing happiness, and 
that is God. You are God, and to drink deeply of that ever-flowing 
spring of happiness, you must turn to yourself, to the Divine Atma 
which, however obscured, is always the resident of your heart, the 
subtle truth of your being.
