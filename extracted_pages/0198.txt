BABA'S TEACHINGS 181
"The Atma, the Lord, the Divine Happiness is not our ever-
constant experience, for it is obscured by such activities of the 
mind as doubt, depression, hatred, jealousy, envy, craving, 
attachments to objects and persons, and ignorance about 
oneself, about God, and about the world.
"In order to expel these dangerous and harmful tendencies from 
one's life, one needs to engage in Sadhana. The objective of all 
types of Sadhana is purification of mind and heart. For this 
reason it is said that one should do good, see good, and be good.
"Love is the vital and essential reality of spiritual life. In human 
life, love takes a number of different aspects — love for wife and 
children, for various habits and indulgences, for various objects, for 
certain ideas, and for God. God is love, and He is there in each 
aspect of love. It is as when pure clear water is poured into bottles 
of different colors. In each differently-colored bottle, the water 
appears to be differently-colored. Yet, truly, the water remains pure 
and clear. Although love, which is God, appears to be modified and 
even distorted in man, yet, truly, that Divine Love remains pure and 
perfect. That love in man, which is pure and perfect, is his love for 
God. Only love for God is perfect. Gather your love from all 
aspects of your life and let it flow as one strong, deep river of love 
to God. Nothing else is needed. No other Sadhana is necessary. 
Happiness and peace will be yours."
