182 MY BABA AND I
The sage, Paramananda, had ten disciples, each a notorious 
example of sloth and stupidity! On their travels, they came 
across a river, which they waded through, to the other bank. 
The water came up to their necks in some places, and so, when 
they struggled onto land, they decided to find out whether all 
had arrived safely. They feared that some of them must have 
been swept away by the swift current. Fear and the consequent 
confusion heightened their native stupidity. At last, they 
discovered that one of them had been washed away, for, 
whenever each of the ten counted the others standing in a line 
before him, he left himself out and found only nine men before 
him. All ten confirmed the conclusion that one of them had 
disappeared in the flood! And, the ten wailed for the lost man 
and were so plunged in sorrow that the hullabaloo they raised 
brought a farmer to their side. He asked them why and got the 
answer that of the ten who waded across, one was drowned! 
The farmer saw that there were ten men before him! They 
challenged his verdict and demonstrated how they counted and 
verified that one had really been lost. The farmer then told 
them that each one had omitted to count himself. The outward 
vision was wrong; the inward vision alone can reveal the truth, 
he advised them.
We are trying to discover God, searching for Him throughout 
the Universe. But we omit to investigate His existence within 
ourselves as the very core and keystone of our Being. When you 
discover yourself — your Self — all wailing ceases and you 
attain supreme happiness. This is real self-knowledge.
