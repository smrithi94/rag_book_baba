January, 1978 
JH: Devotees in New York would like to have a guideline for 
personal life, similar to the administrative Guidelines for Centers.
SAI: The principal thing is that the life and the work should be 
dedicated to God.
JH: Swami, they would like a series of do's and don'ts to guide them 
through the day.
SAL: There are so many different vocations and professions that 
each has its appropriate code of behavior. One vital principle for 
everyone is to do no harm to others. We should do everything in our 
power to help others.
JH: A big problem that faces these young people is that of drugs. It 
is the general belief that marijuana is not harmful.
SAI: At first, a drug may make the person feel strong and 
confident. But all drugs are unnatural in their effect on the mind, 
and they do positive harm to the brain and to the spiritual capacity. 
The spiritual aspirant, the devotee of God should not make use of 
drugs.
JH: Most young people, not only in New York, have the desire to, or 
feel pressure to engage in intensive social life. What is the correct 
attitude for Sai devotees?
SAI: Social Service, yes. Idle social life is not good.
