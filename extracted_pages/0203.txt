186 MY BABA AND I
JH: Swami, the devotee arises in the morning, and then what for 
the day?
SAI: The awakening each morning should be a new birth. After 
awakening, be quiet for a few minutes. Pray to God for strength to 
live the day in dedication to Him, and for the strength to help 
others. At night time, there is a new death. Recollect the day — but 
not in detail, and offer it to the Almighty. In the morning, the day 
was dedicated to God. At night, the day's work and its fruit is laid 
as an offering at His Lotus Feet.

JH: Swami, new Centers, with maybe only three people, want to 
have some other people come to their meetings, but months pass 
and nobody comes. Could they do something like posting a 
notice of their meeting at places like health food stores?
SAI: No. Swami prefers that additional people come only through 
observing the virtuous lives of the Center members, and by word of 
mouth. Notices and such might start small, but in time they will get 
out-of-hand. Even such small things as notices will be taken as an 
advertising of Swami. Other Swamis have to advertise and even 
provide transport, but Sai does no advertising, yet thousands come. 
Sai even tells the people here to go home, but they stay. There is 
this difference.
JH: Then the small Centers will need to just patiently wait for 
membership increases?
SAI: Yes.
JH: Swami, some questions arise in the American Centers for 
which I do not have an answer. Many people of Jewish faith do not 
understand why the symbol of the Jewish faith is not included in 
the Sai symbol of all religions, since the Jewish people exceed in 
numbers some of the religions represented in the Sai symbol.
SAI: It is not through any intention that the Jewish symbol is 
excluded. In India, there is not a general awareness that the Jewish 
symbol is substantially different. Does the Cross fail to symbolize 
the Jewish faith to a substantial degree?
MG: Yes, Swami. There is a substantial difference.
