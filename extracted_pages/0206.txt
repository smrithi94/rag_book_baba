CONVERSATIONS WITH BABA 189
SAL: To the good. In a few years, all will be peaceful.
JH: But Swami, it is getting worse, and it is the Kali Yuga (a world 
period of diminishing virtue).
SAL: No. It is not as bad now as it was. It is like in the ocean. There 
is a time of high waves, and there may be some peak waves that 
crash heavily on the shore, but this is followed by a calm and 
peaceful sea.
JH: Many people are saying that, very shortly, we will enter a period 
of great catastrophe.
SAI: There may be some peak waves, as I mentioned, but the world 
will be happy, peaceful, and prosperous.
GUEST: No world war?
SAL: No. No world war.
JH: We are fortunate to be alive so that we may see this peaceful 
world.
SAL: You will all see it. Even old men will live to see it. GUEST: 
Then Prema Sai will not have much work to do! Swami will have 
made the world peaceful.
SAL: That is some 40 years away. At that time the world will be 
peaceful. That is the Name: Prema Sai. All will be love — love, love, 
love everywhere.
GUEST: It would be good to be reborn in the time of Prema Sai!
SAL: It is best to merge with God. No rebirth.

SAI: In all countries there is a rapid deterioration of the human 
quality.
JH: When will it change for the better?
SAI: Soon there will be a change.
JH: When is soon, Swami? Twenty years? Ten years?
SAI: No. Now. Already there is some slight improvement in India. 
One cause of the general deterioration in the world is rapid 
communication. This allows advertising and publicity to have a 
strong influence on people. Your American election is an illustration 
of how the leaders are television actors.
JH: Swami, there is no evidence of a change for the better.
