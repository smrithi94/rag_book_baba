190 MY BABA AND I
SAI: If there is a change, it will be a universal change. Not local. It 
will occur everyplace.
JH: This rapid world-wide communication also results in common 
knowledge of how to build an atom bomb. Is there not a great 
danger of some small nation using the bomb?
SAI: The danger is not of someone using the bomb. People are no 
longer afraid of death from the bomb. So long as they can pursue 
their objective of getting money, they are willing to risk death and 
to die. It is not the bomb that is the danger, it is the mind that is the 
danger. The bomb exists only as an instrument of the mind. The 
need is for a change of mind.
JH: But Swami, people do not care to learn about that. They have 
no interest in Swami or in listening to him.
SAI: Minds can and do change. For example, the life style of 
people can be so bad that they become ashamed and change. The 
hippies' life style is so low and so dishonest and immoral that 
groups of hippies, observing their own life reflected in another 
group, become ashamed and of themselves they change.
JH: Well, at least Swami's devotees know about changing the 
mind and can do so.
SAI: Were it not for the mind change of Sai devotees the world 
would already have fallen into complete chaos. The deterioration 
of mind and man has been very rapid and abrupt, even precipitous 
during the last fifteen years. That the world is not in total 
destruction is due to the change in mind of Sai devotees and to 
Sai's Grace. You are not aware of it, just as you are not aware of 
your eyes until they are lost. In the same way, the world is not 
aware of Sai's Grace.

A request was made to Baba that he deliver a discourse directly to 
the Jewish people; a unique, ancient and powerful minority in the 
society of the world. The occasion for a major discourse was not at 
hand, but Baba graciously called all the Jewish devotees
