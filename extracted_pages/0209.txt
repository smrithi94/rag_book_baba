192 MY BABA AND I
SAI: All peoples were created by God. Thus all are His
chosen people.
Q: What is the significance of Hitler?
SAI: Hitler's actions were activated by ego and power.
Q: For what reason have the Jews been persecuted?
SAI: For every event there is a cause. There is no reason. Sai
acts only for love, for the benefit of others. He has no desires. He
has no selfish interest.
Q: God appeared to the Jews as a burning bush.
SAI: God appears in any form. It is according to His wish,
not because of any necessity or limitation. It is His choice. God is
formless. He is Sound. He can take any form according to His
wish.
Q: Is Sai the Messiah of the Jews?
SAI: That is not for Sai to say. That must be determined by
you. The real Messiah is the totality of good. Sai is not any partic-
ular thing. He is everything.

In the car with Swami at Brindavan: —
Sai to devotee driver: "To the Gokulum."
SAI: This area is now very busy. The College is here, and
now there are the fields to the left. There are 60 acres, and there is
the land on the college side also.
JH: Are the lands irrigated?
SAI: All is under irrigation.
JH: Where does the water come from?
SAI: We have dug wells. They produce a large volume of
water.
JH: Is the water good? Is is fit to drink?
SAI: It is good, sweet water.
JH: How deep are the wells?
SAI: Fifteen to twenty feet deep.
JH: But Swami, that is very shallow. Usually wells need to go
beneath the surface water table in order to be sweet.
SAI: But Swami located where to dig.
JH: Well, that is different!
