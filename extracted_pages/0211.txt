194 MY BABA AND I
JH: How about the two cows at Prasanthi Nilayam? Are they still 
good?
SAI: Yes. The two from you and Mrs. Hislop still give more than 
30 liters of milk a day. Now they have had five calves each. Very 
good cows.
MG: Will the new university use computers?
SAI: No. No computers. The National Exams were put on 
computers. It was a disaster. The many errors caused severe dis-
tress. Some students committed suicide. Afterwards, when the 
parents were told that the deceased students had really made high 
passing grades, much suffering resulted. The growing tendency to 
rely on computers and calculators to provide answers to problems is 
bringing about a rapid deterioration of intellect. In times past, 
people had to use their brains to think long and hard on problems. 
Now, the mental work is handed over to a computer and the mental 
faculties deteriorate through disuse.
MG: But is it not possible to use computers in a constructive and 
beneficial way?
SAI: Yes, this is going on. There is the intention to use them in 
ways that are beneficial and constructive. The immediate results 
appear to be very good. But in the long run the use of computers 
and calculators will result in a severe deterioration of human in-
tellectual power.
JH: Swamiji, a personal question, please. Is December 9 the 
correct day for our departure, or would another date be better? 
SAI: December 9 is the correct day. It is a good day.
JH: Dr. S. wants to publish Swami's Christmas day talks. 
SAI: Go ahead. He may do that.
JH: The translations are those that Mr. Kasturi once showed to 
Swami. I carefully read every word.
SAI: It is all right.
MG: Swami, on Wednesday the Jewish festival of lights starts and 
continues for 8 days. Could the Jewish devotees have the lights 
burning here at Brindavan?
SAI: Oh, yes. They may do so.
MG: Where, Swami?
SAI: Under the central tree in the compound.
MG: Would Swami light the first lamp in the evening?
SAI: Yes, yes, I will do that.
