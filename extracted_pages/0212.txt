CONVERSATIONS WITH BABA 195
December 9, 1980
JH: I have asked important persons around Sai if Sai is all knowing 
at all times, or only when he so chooses. They give different 
answers.
SAI: Sai knows everything. That people are in doubt is due to the 
Maya of the Avathar. You know that Sai is in your heart, yet you 
think, "Is Sai upstairs in his room, or is he elsewhere?" It is the 
human element. The body has the name of "Hislop," but you are 
not the body. You are the Atma. There is no desire in Sai. There 
is total purity only. This entire body is Amrith. Where is there 
space for desire in Sai? Everything is already mine. Sai does not 
think. My will is immediately realized. Whatever it may be, it 
instantly appears. An envelope, gold, everything. Where is there 
room for desire? I have no thought. If I think, it is for you, it is 
not for me. Sai requires no food. If I eat, it is for the benefit of 
everyone. If I give Darshan, it is not for me, it is for others. I am 
talking to you now — it is for you, not for me. A point does not 
appear in Sai. First a point, then disappoint! I am always the 
same. I am love, always love. If there are angry words, that is ac-
tion. Inwardly, I remain the same. I have the same tender love 
for that person.
JH: Swami, some tragedy happens to a person, and they try to find a 
reason for it in the actions of this lifetime.
SAI: Yes, that can be.
JH: But I thought that all that happens in this life is the result of our 
behavior in past existences.
SAI: Not always. Something could happen with its cause in this life.

JH: Swami, please restate or redefine the goal, the objective of the 
American Sathya Sai Organization.
SAI: It is not just the American, it is the objective for worldwide 
Sathya Sai Organizations.
People, the world over, do not know they are Divine. They do not 
even realize what it is to be human. They have ego, anger,
