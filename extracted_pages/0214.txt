CONVERSATIONS WITH BABA 197
SAI: At the center everything is liquid.
RB: Does Swami mean the world?
SAI: Yes, everything is melted. No temperature.
RB: No heat, Swami?
SAI: No temperature. Everything is liquid. Like water.
Gold, iron, silver, gems, all are liquid. Next there is solid. Then
trees.
JH: Trees, Swami? Trees like we see around us?
SAI: Yes, trees. Then human beings and animals. At the very
center is the Divine. It is the support of everything. First is liquid,
chemistry. Then solid, physics. Then trees, botany. Then man, the
pinnacle of life. But at the center, supporting all, is the Divine.
Without the Divine, where is chemistry, physics, botany? Like this
will be the teaching of all courses at the University. The students
will understand the full picture.
JH: In this picture, Swami, where do the devas and demigods
and other creatures of the cosmos fit in?
SAI: They are above the senses. Man is below the senses.
Those others are above the senses.
JH: But all must come to be humans in order to merge with
God, is it not so?
SAI: Not totally so. There is love.
JH: Then, can man take a further step and go into the world
above the senses.
SAI: That is possible.
JH: But is it not possible to realize the Self, or merge with
God, while in the human state?
SAI: Oh, yes. That can be done.
JH: Does Swami mean that both possibilities exist, that man
could go one way or the other?
SAI: Yes, one way or the other.
JH: Then what makes the difference? What is the difference
in man that he would make one choice or the other?
RB: That is what I want to know, too.
SAI: Love is the dominant reason. Compassionate love is
pure love, unselfish. In the animal there is love, but it is mixed with
lust. But compassion is pure love. Only man has compassion.
Through love he may realize the oneness of life, and in this way,
by love, he will be one with God.
