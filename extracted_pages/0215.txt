198 MY BABA AND I
JH: Then, Swami, man can definitely realize God while in the 
human birth?
SAI: Yes.
JH: But suppose he fails in that, and thus eventually finds himself 
as a being above the sensory level, what then?
SAI: The same holds true. God is love and wherever there is pure 
love and love only, that is God. Love is everything, but people do 
not understand love. Their understanding is confused. For example: 
There is a child. Mother and father love the child with pure love. 
The child is kissed and fondled and showered with affection. This 
is the action of pure love. In this action there is no lust; there is no 
lust in that love. Another example: A father is 40 years old. There 
is the wife and the daughter who is 18 years of age. The love of the 
father for his family leads him to kiss his daughter. In this action of 
love, there is no lust. It is pure love, compassion. The husband also 
kisses his wife, and in this kiss there is some mixture of lust. In 
both cases, the kiss was the action of love, but the love was 
different.
JH: Swami, that is a wonderful explanation. The difference is very 
clear, and very important to understand.
SAI: Pure love, Divine love is everything.
RB: How do human beings realize and become that divine, pure 
compassionate love?
SAI: It will come with sadhana. There is a big mistake in the 
consideration of meditation as the principal sadhana. What is 
meditation? Meditation controls the mind. It is mental. The 
genuine sadhana is that pure love which is not different from the 
Divine.

JH: In America, when they hear of Sai, some people declare that 
he is the Anti-Christ.
SAI: Some individual ideas of some people. Goldstein has in-
dividual ideas. Hislop has individual ideas. I know what is not 
good, and I know what is good. All my ideas and actions are based 
on what is good for the world. I am pure, I have no worries, I have
