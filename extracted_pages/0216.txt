CONVERSATIONS WITH BABA 199
no anxieties, I am happy always, I have no anger. I want nothing, 
take nothing, do nothing for myself. All I think, all I do at all times is

JH: We could also have the same ideas by doing as Swami does.
SAI: Yes, to follow Swami is the important thing. To follow this

RB: I am trying to follow Swami's instructions.
SAL: Trying? Trying is no good. Do it! Do it!
JH: We can ask Swami for strength!

Peter was near and dear to Christ. But he denied Christ.

SAL: Yes. It was because of body identification. Judas was also near

JH: I pray that my faith in Sai will not waver.
SAI: The important thing is to do good and be good. Do not see the 
bad. See only the good.
