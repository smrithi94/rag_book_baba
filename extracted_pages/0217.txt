200 MY BABA AND I 
training plan for instruction in human values throughout the en-
tire school system of India, I can see that Sai is getting hold of 
India.
SAI: Amongst the spiritual leaders of India there is some jealousy.
JH: But they do not have public works. Only Swami is doing that.
SAI: Sai Baba is working for the public twenty-four hours a day. 
Even the interviews are public work. Twenty-four hours per day, 
365 days per year. Not even one holiday.
JH: But that is beyond man. It is possible only for the Divine. 
SAI: Yes. Only for the Divine. I need no holiday. I am always 
happy, always in bliss.

(In the Car with Baba)
AC: What to do with a devotee who is making friction in a Center?
SAI: Out. Put them out.
JH: Our discipline is very strict in the American Centers. 
SAI: That is correct. Sai's English has improved?
JH: Yes, Swami. It is greatly improved.
SAI: All is love. All is love. The Russians are rationalists. Faith is 
of the greatest importance. Words, words, words; reason will not 
do. Faith is from the heart, the language of the heart.
JH: But faith is a gift from God. Man can only have it if God wills.
SAI: Yes, God blesses. Purity helps. Swami is soft as butter, but 
hard as a diamond. Butter soft, diamond hard. Some small freedom 
I allow. Not very much. The end of wisdom is freedom. That is the 
true freedom. Discipline is important. Swami demands strict 
discipline. Many foreigners are outside in the village. There man 
can sit beside woman. And they can smoke. Inside the Ashram, 
Swami does not allow that.
JH: A good small pamphlet explaining the rules of the Ashram 
should be given to everyone. The people do not know.
