CONVERSATIONS WITH BABA 201
Germans in the round building play loud tape recorders because they 
do not know better.
SAL: In a room next to Admissions, someone should repeat the 
rules to each newcomer.
JH: An important statement of Swami's is that we should ignore 
the faults of others. But how does one put this into practice? If 
one is dealing with a person, the fault must be taken into 
account; the fault may ruin the situation.
SAL: Inside himself, the person is not like that. He knows he is 
wrong. If the fault is being expressed, move away from the person, 
keep a distance. Then the person will see he is wrong and will 
approach you in penance.

SAI: What counts is faith. Faith is of great importance. God 
should be installed in every thought and act. There may be a per-
son who is the owner of a house. A tenant may be taken into the 
house, and year after year the tenant may pay the rent. At last, 
after many years of paying the rent, the tenant owns the house.
JH: Why would that be?
SAI: The owner might say, "The house is mine." But the tenant 
will reply, "No. The house is now mine." That is the law. JH: Is 
that the law in this situation?
SAL: Yes. It is the same with the Lord. He is the "renter." Your 
body and mind is the "house." Once you have brought Him into 
the house and installed Him there, in due course, He is the "
owner." The house no longer belongs to "you." It is now the 
dwelling of God. It is fully "owned" by Him.
JH: Swami! That is wonderful! That is the way to come to the 
point of "Surrender to the Lord." By keeping Baba in heart and 
mind, gradually and naturally, there is full surrender.
SAL: Yes, it comes to be quite naturally. But not everyone is able to 
do it. Devotion and faith need be very strong.
JH: But cannot everyone make a start?
SAL: Yes, certainly, a start can be made.
JH: May I tell this to our Sai Centers in America?
SAI: You may tell.
