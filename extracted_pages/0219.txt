202 MY BABA AND I
December 2, 1982
(In the Car with Baba)
JH: Swami gives three stages of evolution beyond the human: 
Superhuman, Cosmic, Absolute. What does superhuman mean?
SAI: Superhuman is the stage of complete detachment from Body 
and World. Something may be said or done at this stage to benefit 
humanity and the world, but the Superhuman is no longer a part of 
the world of men nor involved in the interests of men.
JH: Are there such people now?
SAI: Oh, yes.
JH: Are they those people in the Himalayan Mountains who can be 
invisible and do the extraordinary things we hear about?
SAL No. Those individuals are still seeking liberation. But it is 
temporary.
JH: Temporary, Swami! That is awful! To get liberation and then 
lose it!
SAI: There are three kinds of liberation. It is experienced in one 
type of Samadhi. Then, a person who is engaged in Sadhana can 
suddenly — like a flash of lightening — have a clear vision of the 
Truth, but it fades and ordinary life resumes. Liberation cannot be 
permanent without total surrender.
JH: Then, if not the people in the Himalayas, who are the 
Superhumans?
SAI: (Naming half a dozen or so of the ancient sages) These people 
were totally above human and worldly life, although for the benefit 
of others, they would give certain advice and engage in certain 
actions.
JH: But that was long ago. Are there Superhumans in this day and 
age?
SAI: Oh, yes. There are. But today, outwardly, they live in Society 
and outwardly cannot be recognized.
JH: What is the Cosmic stage?
SAI: No body, no mind. Both have disappeared. Body, feelings, 
mind, intelligence are no longer there. Just love, just spirituality.
JH: Are there entities, individuals, in the Cosmic stage? SAI: 
No. No individuals. More similar to currents of spiritual 
power.
