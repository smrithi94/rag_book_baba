CONVERSATIONS WITH BABA 203
JH: Well, the Absolute is Swami. That is understood. When 
Swami says He will confer liberation at death, what does that 
mean?
SAI: It means that birth is finished with, there is no more birth again.
JH: But Swami, there is this temporary liberation that was 
mentioned. Maybe it is that kind?
SAI: No, it is not like that. Sai gives total, final, liberation. JH: 
Could there be the ending of individuality, too?
SAI: There could be.
JH: Individuality is a nuisance.

SAI: That is just mental.
JH: But the Buddha speaks of Hell as a place.
SAI: It is a place. A place of the mind. A mental state in which there 
is much worry and suffering. It is an after-death state. Sai is here to

that man is born with a dual gift from God — Discrimination and 
Conscience. And, that because of conscience, everyone knows right 
from wrong; for if he were to do wrong, his conscience would 
trouble him.
SAI: Yes, that is the case.
JH: But people point out, Swami, that people of one religion
