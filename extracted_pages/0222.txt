CONVERSATIONS WITH BABA 205
the attention of people of substance and importance throughout the 
world.
SAI: Sai does not look at status and worldly importance. He looks at 
the heart.
JH: Yes, Swami, but it is the leaders in society who tend to arouse 
the attention and interest of the general population.
SAI: Sai does not force such things. He will be in body for many 
more years. What you refer to will develop naturally. Devotees 
of world stature, able to speak of Sai, will be present when the 
time is correct for them.
JH: What were the mistakes, if any, in the teachings of the Buddha?
SAI: There were no mistakes in his teachings. One mistake he made 
was to allow women to come close to him in the Sangha. It was a 
woman who gave him the meat, the poisoned meat which killed him.
JH: It was his custom to accept whatever was given into the begging 
bowl, even if it was meat.
SAI: That was a second mistake. Here he failed to put his teaching 
into practice — his teaching was Ahimsa — total nonviolence to all 
creatures.
JH: The Buddha taught that Nibbana (Nirvana) was the ultimate 
goal. Is that different from the Liberation of which Swami speaks?
SAI: It is the same. Nirvana, Liberation, Realization are just 
different words.
(NOTE: On the road to Anantapur, we came upon a woman beggar 
who was blind. Baba gave her money and she responded with "Sai 
Ram, Swami." It had been two years since he had been to Anantapur, 
but without Baba even speaking, she recognized him.)
JH: The woman seems to be happy.
SAI: She was born blind but is always happy. She has no worries.
JH: How could that be? Look at her life. It must be a life of misery.
SAI: Why? She has no desires and is content. She does not know the 
life of the person who has eyes. She does not think that others are 
different from her. Her family is worried about her condition, but 
she has no worries.
