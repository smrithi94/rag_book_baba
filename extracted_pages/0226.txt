teachings, but who do not join the Organization. The Organization 
imposes some discipline and requirements which these people do not 
wish to take on.
The Sai Organization may be limited in size now, but as time goes 
on, it will attract so many people that the general public will not be 
able to be accommodated in the Sai gatherings. All available spaces 
will be assigned to the people within the Sai Organization. Thus, the 
Sai Organization membership affords a chance.
For example, you are Chairman of the American Sai Organization, 
and Bozzani is the Officer of the Foundation (i.e. Sathya Sai Society 
of America). Because of this, you are in the car with Swami, having 
some nine hours of interview instead of half an hour in the interview 
room.

Group Interview with Baba
SAI: Faith is like a fire mountain. It is like an ice mountain. There is 
nothing else. There is no doubt.
JH: What is doubt?
SAI: Doubt is confusion. When reading books, one writer says one 
thing and another writer says another thing. Take one idea and follow 
it. Rama had one will, one arrow, one mind. The arrow is 
intelligence.
JH: Where, then, does discrimination play its part?
SAI: Discrimination is to look to conscience.
JH: In choosing a path to follow, one should not decide amongst 
ideas by the use of logic?
SAI: No. Not by ideas. By conscience, by Self-confidence. Do not 
follow another. Follow yourself. To follow another is to be a slave. 
Who are you? "I am not body, not mind, not even Atma." For, "I am 
Atma" is two — "I" and "Atma." Neti, neti, neti — not this, not this, 
not this — that is the way of the Vedas. Swami is in your heart. 
Think of Him there.
JH: What is God's Light, Swami — what is the light of God? SAI: 
When Truth is joined with Love. That is the light of God. It is not 
outside light, like the electric light bulb. It is inner light.
