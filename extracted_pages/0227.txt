210 MY BABA AND I
JH: Swami, how to be in that Light? Everyone here would like to 
be in that Light and stay all day in that Light.
SAI: When in a dark room and you are looking with a torch, 
everything can be seen except one thing. Yourself, you do not see. 
With your eyes you are seeing, but if the torch is turned on you, the 
objects of the room are not seen. As long as your attention is on the 
light which lights the world, you will not be enjoying God's Light.
JH: To be in God's Light, the union of truth and love, how is that to 
be approached?
SAI: Meditation. Meditation is looking inward. It is light. (NOTE: 
The implication seems to be that as long as our attention is centered 
on our worldly life, we will be seeing the world and not seeing 
God).
SAI: I see good only. Everyone is God. There are some bad actions 
only.
JH: That is very hard to understand, Swami.
SAI: No. Not hard. Easy.
SAI (to Malaysian group): All of you are God. There is only He.
SAI (to Barbara): Who are you?
BB: Barbara.
SAI: No! That is only body name. Body is not you. Body has 
relatives, but soul has no relatives. There is only one Soul, and that 
is God.

In the Car with Baba, Srinivas, and Radhakrishna
We had gone to the Sai school at the foot of Nandi Hill. A beautiful 
and peaceful setting, with a hundred-acre campus including 
orchards, dairy, and farm crops. There was a grand reception for 
Baba by the boys and the faculty. Two students spoke at the 
meeting after the reception and Baba gave a discourse. One of the 
speakers broke down in tears. During his discourse, Baba would 
stop for a moment and question some of the small boys to see if 
they were paying attention to what he had been saying.
SAI: What did you think of the first speaker? (The boy spoke in 
English).
