216 MY BABA AND I
SAI: Yes. That is the fact, and it is practical.
AC: But Swami! Then it is God doing evil!
SAI: At first, maybe (i.e. apparently), but then not. It is not God 
who does evil. Evil is from the ego.
AC: When I die . . .
SAI: (interrupting) Who are you? You do not die! The body is like 
clothes — off and on.
AC: Then after the body dies, I take another? Why? Why?
SAI: Balance of desires. Desires are like seeds — they sprout. 
These desires cause rebirth. Finish with desires — no more birth. 
Mind is a desire bundle.
AC: But this creation — world, body, and mind — is it a pro-
jection of the Atma? Mind, body, intelligence are creations, pro-
jections of the Atma?
SAI: Creation is from the Atma. The Atma, God, is the positive. 
Body is the negative. They join and action results. Otherwise, 
nothing.
AC: There is the Atma, and then creation as the projection from 
the Atma . . .
SAI: No! That is where the mistake is made! Creation is not a 
projection from the Atma. The Atma, God, is permeating every 
fibre of the creation. The form is just appearance . . . It is energy, 
God, the Divine Energy which causes the form and which is the 
actuality of the form. (Following this exchange there was some 
personal conversation with C, which is omitted.)
JH: To do all these tasks, Swami, takes a lot of energy. Human 
energy is low, and Swami says to call on the Divine Energy. 
How?
SAI: Yes, human energy is low and the Divine Energy is without 
limit! You are God!
JH: Does Swami mean that when the human energy limit is felt, 
that I should reject it as false, and instead identify myself as God, as 
He Who is limitless energy?
SAI: Yes. Reject it! Look at your shadow — you are sitting and 
your shadow is there. When you stand up, your shadow also 
grows. Your shadow is the human energy. You are the Divine 
Energy. When you rise, and also do the Divine work, your energy 
grows.
