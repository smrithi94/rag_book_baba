CONVERSATIONS WITH BABA 217
January 15, 1983
JH: Swami, the Divine Energy versus limited human energy 
. . .
SAI: There is only Divine Energy.
JH: But what seems to me to be my human energy does not seem to 
be sufficient; for example, the trip to Central America.
SAL: All is God. Know that it is He who is Energy. Then all is well.
JH: Oh! When the human energy slows, leave it and know that the 
truth is Divine Energy! Like when some years ago on long drives, 
Baba would look a little tired; and then, instantly, he would be fresh 
like a flower.
SAL: Do not equate this body with human bodies. It is only the 
appearance of a form for the sake of the devotees. There is nothing of 
Swami except for his devotees. There are no desires. This body is 
just an appearance of form . . . There is matter. There is human. 
There is Divine. Matter is selfishness; human is selfishness plus help 
(i.e. help to others); God is no selfishness, just total love. As the 
base, selfishness is essential for health and prosperity. Without 
health, what can be done? Work for these must be done? Work for 
these must be done; then help others; then God only.
JH: But Swami, even in that worldly work of necessary "selfishness,"
 where is "I"? Surely it is only God who is doing that work?
SAI: That is better. That is the best way. You are only an 
instrument for Swami, an instrument which Swami is using for his 
purpose — U.S. Chairman, speaking of Swami's teachings and so 
on.
November 7, 1983
The interview of November 7 was very brief in terms of the group. 
Almost all of the time was devoted to individual interviews with 
Baba in the inner interview room. Families were taken together, but 
single persons were interviewed individually.
SAL: What is Being?
Q: It is "Sat."
SAI: That is just a Sanskrit word. Being means immortality, always.
