218 MY BABA AND I
Q: How to feel that Divine Love in the heart?
SAI: Your love, my love, they are the same. There is only One and 
He is God.
Q: Do You mean we should affirm that, that we should always say 
it?
SAI: Here is humanity (pointing to a line in the wall denoting a 
layer of bricks). Below is the world, above is God. Aim up, not 
down. You are God. There is only One. For so many lives you have 
been declaring that you are human, with limitations, "I am faulty . . 
. I am . . . so and so . . . " That is wrong. Now say, "I am God." 
Never feel or say that you are other than God. You will show Godly 
qualities. You will have Godly powers. You will be God. Thoughts. 
If there are no thoughts, there are no actions. How is your health, 
Hislop?
H: It is very good, Swami.

asked him to change the bracelet into something pretty. It seemed 
to me that Baba was not pleased with the demand, but nevertheless 
he removed the bracelet, held it with two fingers, blew his breath 
upon it, and it became a new shining gold bracelet of an entirely 
different pattern and configuration.
At this point, the group portion of the interview ended and Swami 
began the series of private conversations in the inner interview 
room.)

at Prasanthi Nilayam

the center flanked by two white diamonds, all gems showing large flat 
facets. Then, for a lady who had a large Jappmala of seeds, Baba 
created a Jappmala of matched pearls, and showed her how to use it: 
The thumb, standing separate, may be taken to represent God. The 
first finger, representing the individual person, is joined to
