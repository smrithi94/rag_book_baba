CONVERSATIONS WITH BABA 221
SAI: Yes. If you have God loving you, then no sadhana, no 
meditation, no inquiry, nothing more is needed, for then everything 
is God, thoughts are of God, only God is seen, the whole day is God 
only.
Q: What is soul?
SAI: Soul is the Atma. It does not die. You are Atma, not body.
Q: But Swami, there is something else. Something has results.
SAL: Yes, result is from desire. It is like this golden watch band 
you are wearing. You wish for a ring; the gold is taken from the 
bracelet and it becomes a ring. Then you are no longer pleased 
with a ring, but instead long for a golden necklace. The gold is 
taken and it becomes a necklace. All are different forms, but the 
gold is the same.
JH: Swami informs us that this life in the world is a dream only.
SAI: Yes, a dream.
JH: But Swami works endlessly in the dream. Why?
SAI: If the dream is realized as such, then the world is done with. 
Swami helps those caught in the dream.
JH: But it is still a dream, without purpose or end. Why bother with 
it?
SAI: A big scientist may know that a child's world is a dream and has 
no reality which is lasting. But this does not prevent him from sitting 
down with the child at the child's level. Again, Sai could be likened 
to an aircraft which briefly touches down in order to take passengers 
up from the ground.
JH: Swami! There is room for only a limited number!
SAL: Limited, yes! Always there is room for a limited number only.
JH: Swami! How to get a booking?
SAI: By Grace. Booking is through Grace.
JH: The limitation is severe.
SAL: Yes. It is true that reservations have been made. But on the 
plane, the Government has some seats reserved. Swami can say, "
Hislop is given one of those reservations."
JH: What is the difference between Swami's Grace and Swami's 
Blessings?
