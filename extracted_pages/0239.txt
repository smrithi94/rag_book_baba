222 MY BABA AND I
SAI: They are the same. Swami's Blessings, his Grace, his Love — 
all mean the same.
Q: How to get Swami's Grace?
SAI: Swami's Grace is always here. Swami is always here. He is 
here for all; for everyone. I am always calling, but they do not 
listen, they do not come. What can I do?
(Now Swami calls people in turn to the inner interview room for a 
brief, private conversation. As he moves to the doorway, he says, "I 
am always happy. My bliss is ever full and never disturbed.")
JH: Because Swami knows that this world of experience is only a 
dream. (Sai makes no reply.)

SAI: Yes, that is correct. The rule cannot be changed. It must 
continue unchanged through the next ten years.
JH: Then what shall be the particular emphasis for American 
devotees for the next ten years?

JH: During the course of the next ten years is the American Sai 
Organization to remain a Spiritual Organization or is it to change its 
mode of life so as to become primarily a Seva Organization?
SAI: The Organization is to continue to be a Spiritual
