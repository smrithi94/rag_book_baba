CONVERSATIONS WITH BABA 225
SAI: Yes. The action is prompted by God.
JH: But Swami, it is not clear in practice. I forgot to bring the 
check I wanted to donate to the hospital. Then, after reaching the 
veranda here, I remembered it and felt I should go back to the 
room and get it. That action of returning to our room had to be a 
prompting by Baba. But then, after Baba prompted me to get the 
check, Baba refused to accept the check! The principle in practice 
is not clear.
SAI: Only in that way was there an occasion to teach you how 
Swami regards such matters. Had you given the check from love, 
perhaps Swami could have accepted. But you were giving in 
return for the operation. But you are family and there is no pay-
ment in family. For work outside the family, there may be some 
employment and some payment.
JH: But it was Swami prompting me that sent me for the check?
SAI: Yes. It was Swami prompting you.
JH: Swami, the lesson of the check is learned. It is a very clear case 
of payment for services instead of the family feeling! Now I take it to 
be the case that whatever is done by me is being prompted by Baba.
SAI: That is the correct attitude. That is the correct way.
JH: But could not a person then say that he had no volition and 
therefore would sit and do nothing unless Swami moved him? Can a 
man choose to be lazy?
SAI: Yes, he could be lazy.
JH: By the prompting of Sai?
SAI: Yes.
JH: Is it the waking 'I' who dreams, or does the dream state create its 
own 'I'?
SAI: It is one 'I' only in waking, dream, and deep sleep states. 
JH: For life in this world, Swami, the goal is reunion with
God. What is the purpose of life in the rest of this vast 
universe? SAI: All life may flow toward God. Even frogs in a 
pond and
insects.
JH: But Swami, that is life in this world. I mean life elsewhere in 
the universe.
SAI: In this world, there is duality and therefore striving. But, even 
here, insects and small creatures may live in a pond feeling
