CONVERSATIONS WITH BABA 227
the mind and its activity clearly. When thought ceases, there will 
be no mind. Mind is a bundle of thoughts. Do not follow the 
thoughts. Then the world will not develop for you. Now your 
thoughts have gone to America, to problems there. But these are 
just thoughts. If you now follow these thoughts and go to 
America, they will bring about the world for you.
JH: Does Swami mean that one should just be a witness to the 
thoughts going through one's mind and not do anything about 
them?
SAI: Exactly. When the mind is destroyed, then the coming into 
being of the world will be clear to you. There is only God, God 
only. Hold to Him. Hold closely to Him and the matter of the 
mind will be resolved.
JH: Swami! I do hold to God! My thought is always on Swami. I am 
always regarding Swami as being in my heart, not someplace else. 
But my mind is not destroyed.
SAI: It will come. To have that strong confidence is important.
JH: I have no trouble seeing that my mind creates my personal 
world — that is, Mr. Kasturi and Swami are known to me only 
because of the senses relaying messages to the mind, which then 
forms concepts and externalizes Mr. Kasturi and Swami. But the 
creation of something big outside, like the war, I cannot 
comprehend.
SAI: When the mind is destroyed and the world goes, God also has 
no existence.
(Now the evening Bhajans start and the interview is over, with many 
questions still unasked. Hopefully, Swami will grant some time again 
at the next visit).
