228 MY BABA AND I
Examine this question, for example: Is man enslaved by external 
objects and the attraction they exercise over him? Or, is it some 
inner impulse that urges him forward to shackle himself to 
sorrow? I shall give an example: There are professional monkey-
catchers in the villages who employ a crude device for the 
purpose. They place in the orchards or gardens infested by the 
marauders a number of narrow-necked earthen pots, with a 
handful of peanuts inside each. The monkey approaches the pot, 
knows that it has the delicious nuts inside, puts its long hand in 
and collects the nuts in its fist. Now, it finds it cannot take its 
arm out; the neck is too narrow for the nut full fist! So, it sits 
helpless and forlorn and is easily caught and transported! It 
thinks that there is someone inside who is holding back its arm, 
when it tries to take it out! If only it had loosened the grip and 
got rid of the attachment to the nuts, it could have escaped! So, 
too, you are the victims of desire and the attachments that the 
desire entails. You are bound by the shackles you have 
yourselves fastened around you! Liberation, too, is in your 
hands. Contemplate the unchanging Glory of God; then desire 
for the transient baubles of the earth will fade and you can be 
free.
