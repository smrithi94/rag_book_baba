232 MY BABA AND I
correspondence to be part of this book. He gave his consent. Usually 
Baba writes by hand on letterhead stationary, although at times he 
will have someone type his letters. In this section, letters in his 
handwriting are reduced in size so as to fit the pages of the book. 
My letters to Baba are all typewritten and appear on these pages 
without a letterhead.
I write to him about anything and everything that comes to mind. 
His letters to me guide my spiritual discipline. The reader will 
notice that at times I mention an illness when writing to Baba. 
Whenever illness comes, my wife and I mentally hand it over to 
Baba and never worry about it. The first paragraph of one letter 
mentions a prayer which Baba wrote out for us; a photocopy of the 
prayer follows the letter.
