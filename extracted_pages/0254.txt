young children of today; then only will the country achieve pro-
gress. The curriculum, methods of teaching and learning, the 
atmosphere of the institution, the behaviour and attitudes of those 
in charge of teaching must also be shown as conforming to the 
ideal. That alone can bring about reform. Or else, men behave like 
beasts. When scholarship and virtues are considered as of no value, 
when spiritual effort becomes wordy exercise, when all activity is 
directed towards the secular and the temporary, real spiritual 
exertion is insulted. Spiritual yearning ought to be either 
completely free from attachment to the sensory and objective 
world, or, it should recognise and visualise God-head, the Lord of 
the Universe, in the sensory and objective world. That sacred vi-
sion and that holy feeling have to be asserted in action. It is only 
thus that the individual Atma can instantly realise and merge in the 
Universal Atma, isn't it?
Hislop, I shall certainly come. It may be a little later, but do not 
feel disappointed. Convey this decision of mine to the Raymer 
Group, the Cowans, Indra Devi, Charles Penn, and their societies 
and give joy to all members of the Sai Family. I shall certainly 
come. After the celebrations of Dasara and Birthday, I shall come 
and be with you, leisurely for an extra month, showering bliss on 
you all.
Special Blessings for Mrs. Hislop.
