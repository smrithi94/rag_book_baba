PRASMANTMI NILAYAM
Hislop, accept my blessings. The letters you sent have all been 
received I have read them all . . but, I was not able to send you 
replies, immediately. Many thousands of devotees had gathered 
during Dasara, the Birthday, and the All-India Conference of Office 
Bearers of Sathya Sai Organizations; and so, I could not avail 
myself of even a moment's leisure. Besides, since the building of the 
College has started, I have been at Bangalore, for about a month. 
Kasturi was at Prasanthi Nilayam, and, letters to you had to be 
translated, and typed. So, the delay lengthened. This is what

shall never forget you. Wherever you are, you are mine. Wherever I 
am, I am yours. The bond between these two is Atmic, (Soul and 
soul) not dependent on time, space, and the vagaries of physical 
encasements.
Hislop, I am drawing your attention to the happenings in some 
homes, of which you have written. Spiritual discipline and

Later, that experience is to be revealed only to those nearest to one, 
those who have earnest and devoted interest in such experiences. I 
do not like the advertisement of such matters in newspapers, 
announcing them to all and sundry, as if they are cheap 
commodities of the market place.
The sweetness of the spirit is not a dish, which can be served over 
the counter. It cannot be procured from a shop; no firm can supply it 
to its customers. It is of the nature of Divine illumination; it has to 
be evoked, from oneself, for oneself. To advertise the experience of 
this illumination is to indulge in a paltry pastime.
There are some people who engage themselves in Sadhana,
