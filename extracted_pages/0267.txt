250 MY BABA AND I
God. I suppose it is only through practice that we can be still and 
allow God to be seen through our action. Swami advises that we 
declare a strike against the mind. Just as we are silent and non-
active in relation to a person who is harmful but with whom we do 
not wish any controversy, we should be likewise in relation to the 
mind until it decides to stop its aggressive empire-building. Such 
brave words are easy for one to say, but one's practice is not so 
easy!
Victoria and I send all our love.
