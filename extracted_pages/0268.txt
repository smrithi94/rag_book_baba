LETTERS 251

Beloved Swamiji:
One is tossed here and there by circumstances, health, emotions, 
mind, and even unstable intelligence. The tendency is to become 
subject to despair at one time and to temporary elation at other 
times. One turns to Swamiji as the only reality — that is, Swamiji 
within, and I hold to him as the nail cleaves to the timber, as the 
sea creature is anchored to its rock. Even though one falters and 
fails, yet only if every act is dedicated to worship of the Divine, is 
there any sense at all to life.
Dearest Baba, enclosed are photo prints. Walter Wolfe, a devotee of 
Swamiji, from the Cowan Center, took the pictures of the crucifix 
using excellent equipment. He will send a full set of the photos to 
Swami. He will also ask if Swami places any particular restriction 
on the uses of the pictures. The photos of the crucifix were shown at 
the Santa Ana Center last month, and everyone wants some.
The figure of Christ as created by Swami is the most outstanding 
work of art any of us have ever seen. Only by enlarging the small 
crucifix can the amazing detail be seen. One realizes at once that 
Jesus must have looked just like that after days on the cross. How 
different the reality is as compared to the conceptions of mundane 
artists! The blood, the agony, the spittle caked with dust, the 
upturned eyes, all create a most penetrating feeling for those people 
with a Christian background. If it would please him, perhaps 
Swamiji could send a note to Mrs. Cowan giving a release on the 
pictures, or noting the restrictions on their use.
For myself and Victoria, I am at work again, as per my letters to 
Swamiji, and Victoria is staying at the Mexican house. This 
afternoon I will drive home; I was there last weekend also.
With all love,
