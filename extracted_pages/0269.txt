252 MY BABA AND I
Jan. 26. 1975
Dearest Swamiji:
Now we are quite happy, for in two weeks we are going to see 
Swami — no reason to look further for the occasion of the 
happiness!
Regardless of the fact that anticipation is a bad fault, I feel more and 
more thrilled that soon we will see Swami. One can sympathize 
with the Gopis wherein they knew that Krishna was in the heart of 
each one of them, yet their life became very sweet only when their 
eyes were seeing Krishna's person and their ears were hearing 
Krishna's voice.
Unless there is a last minute change of schedule, we should arrive 
in Bangalore on February 12.
On February 2, we will attend Mrs. Cowan's first Sri Sathya Sai 
Baba meeting of the new year. Every few weeks we drive to Santa 
Ana and stay with Mrs. Cowan for a day or so. She is remarkably 
well with strong energy, and her will of iron is quite unbent by the 
years.
Victoria and I send all our love to our beloved Sri Baba,
With all love,
P.S. If we would have Swamiji's approval, we plan to stay a couple 
of months and then return again in November.
