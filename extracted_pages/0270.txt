My dear Hislop,
Accept my blessings. Your letter and the circular sent for the 
direction of devotees reached me. I am very happy that things are 
progressing well. I am glad you are healthy and active.

specifically. These are subjects that can be dealt with indirectly, 
rather than directly. We must encourage people to correct

our Organisation, making it distinct from the rest. Let us keep 
away from the undesirable and ignore it, steadily and silently. 
Discussing it and publicly condemning it will only soil us. 
Maintain the atmosphere of purity and divinity; there, evil cannot 
sprout or thrive.
I am happy that even at this old age you are so earnest and active

Dear Hislop! I bless that you carry on your programme of directing 
and developing the Organisation with success. I am
