254 MY BABA AND I
highly satisfied with what you have done and are doing in this
respect. Of course, such success always attracts obstacles, opposi-
tion and even vilification. But, do not pay them any attention. The
diamond becomes brighter with the cutting of more facets. One's
duty is to continue along one's chosen path and fulfil the task, with
undiminished enthusiasm. Truth cannot fail to be valued and
appreciated, one day or other. Be as happy as ever, whatever
happens.
My blessings to your wife. Convey my love and blessings to
Goldstein, Krystal, Sandweiss and others. Also to the Centres.
