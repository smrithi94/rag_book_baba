Beloved Sai:
It is only by the Grace of Swamiji that the lives of Victoria and 
myself are not caught up in the general disaster of people. Thus 
we are not expectant of anything beyond the ordinary routine 
when in Bhagavan's sacred Presence, and it is with much 
hesitation that I presume to ask more.
But, of His own volition, Swamiji said that He would satisfy my 
doubts. And it is from this that I gather the courage to ask for one or 
two interviews (with able translator present).
I have one very large doubt of my own. Also, my wife has run into a 
sort of barrier in her inner life and has a very strongly felt need to 
ask Swami.
In addition to the above, as I visit Sathya Sai Centres, questions are 
asked — some of which I cannot answer, and I need to ask Swamiji 
about these questions from devotees.
