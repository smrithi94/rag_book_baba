256 MY BABA AND I
Dear Hislop,
Accept my Blessings to you and Mrs. Hislop. I received your letter,
conveying your reaction to recent happenings. I am pained to find
they have upset you so much. Every one is eager to serve Swami,
and carry out the duties assigned to him. No one is high or low, no
one is a competitor to another. In order to facilitate the projects that
are planned by the devotees, people have been assigned tasks, but
that does not mean they are in sole or superior charge. Every one
should join hands in loving service.
When the tasks which the Organisation takes up increase in number
and size, naturally, new Committees have to be formed and
entrusted with the new duties.
Mutual adjustment and constant consultation are necessary if a
programme of spiritual service is to succeed. Over-enthusiasm
may make some people commit blunders or do incorrect things.
These have to be overlooked in a generous spirit. Love and
brotherhood must be expressed as both understanding and sym-
pathy.
Dear Hislop, do not lose your peace of mind, when such things
occur. Give your best to the cause and let love flow from your
heart to all. Appreciate the devotion that moves thousands in
America and help in every way to deepen it. I will not allow you to
give up the role I have blessed you with. Know that I am always
with you, in you, beside you, before you.
