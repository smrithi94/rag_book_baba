Dear Hislop,
Blessings to you and your wife.
I received your letter and the enclosed newspaper cutting. The world
has all sorts of people with all sorts of notions. This is its nature,
Hislop. We should not pay attention to such people and their
activities. Devotees must concentrate on Sadhana for their own
advancement, instead of worrying about happenings outside their
sphere.
I saw in the American Newsletter, a contribution sent by you to
share with readers. It deals with trivial topics. We must
discriminate between what is worthwhile and what is not. Seek
always to help readers and members to progress in Spiritual
Sadhana and to understand and practise Swami's teachings.
There are so many constructive and positive directions for
spiritual success that Swami has given. Stress these while writing
and speaking. Meditation transcends the senses. With the mind
made serene by such meditation, one can bravely enter the activi-
ties of life.
Convey my blessings to Mr. and Mrs. Goldstein, Mr. and Mrs.
Bozzani, Mr. and Mrs. Krystal, and all other devotees there.
