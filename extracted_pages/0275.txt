258 MY BABA AND I
Sept. 23, 1982
Dearest Lord:
We (Victoria and myself) are scheduled to arrive in Bangalore on 
Thursday, November 4, and to depart Bangalore on Tuesday, 
December 28. It will be marvelous for us to be again in the divine 
presence of Swamiji.
Dearest Swamiji, it would be good if Swami could give a grand 
discourse on the World. Right now the world is especially painful 
and impossible for limited minds to comprehend without divine 
help.
The horror of the slaughter of men, women, and children without 
distinction or mercy which now goes on in Lebanon, Central 
America, and parts of Africa strikes the people here like a rod of 
blazing iron plunged into the heart. And yet we are so helpless to 
intervene. People hold protest parades, contribute to relief, write 
and phone their representatives in the Government, but no one can 
do anything.
Swamiji! What is the meaning of these hellish eruptions of world 
events?
What is the world?
The world seems to be me; for I do not know the world as a thing in 
itself, but know it only as a picture drawn by sensations arising in 
body and mind. Yet, how can these evil and demonic actions be 
me? I do not find these hellish passions and deeds in myself.
What is the world to an individual?
If the overwhelming impact of the world on my mind and feelings is 
due to ignorance, delusion, and to the lack of having someone who 
knows how to point out the truth of it, then may the divine Swami 
point out the truth of the matter.
One presumes that since Swami has adopted body and mind that he 
will also receive the common sensory and mental impressions. But 
Baba is without ignorance and delusion, and therefore will see a 
thing in itself — if there be such. How does Swami see the evil 
events which are now rising up to a peak in the world?
