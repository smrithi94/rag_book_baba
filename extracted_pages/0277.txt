260 MY BABA AND I
Sept.22, 1983
Dearest Swami:
Victoria and I cannot even attempt to express in words our
appreciation to Swami for his grace showered so lovingly on us
during our visit. The beautiful prayer that Baba wrote for us is our
guide throughout the day. We remember Baba all day long and feel
his presence beside us wherever we go.
Swami's teaching to live God, eat God, drink God, breathe God is
surely the greatest of inspirational statements, and we feel a genuine
intensity to bring our whole lives into tune with God's Will. To
awaken with love, talk with love, act with love, and end the day
with love is the ideal Baba has given, and although we fall short, it
is our strong desire to live like that.
We remember with deep gratitude Baba's divine teaching to meet
each experience with "Yes, Yes, Yes," convinced that every
experience carries God's love and is for our good. His teaching that
there is only one "I" in essential reality and that we are in fact each
living creature that we see, despite "good and bad" actions, is
called to mind each day, and with the eye of reason we try to see
each creature as not different from ourselves. Swami's extraor-
dinary and amazing explanation of real "surrender to God" is con-
stantly in mind, and we understand there is no genuine surrender to
God until the eye of wisdom sees everything, even the imperma-
nent world, as God only.
Every time I go to India, the body gets back home with a severe cold,
but the present cold is tapering off and will soon be gone. Also, the
constant headache that has been a nuisance for a year is lessening and
is strongly felt now only when the brain is jarred by coughing.
Victoria is also recovering her strength which was depleted by the flu,
caught while she was in India. Why she had to be in bed with the flu,
while there, instead of spending each day with Baba as close to him as
possible is a great puzzle to her!
Victoria and I both send our love,
