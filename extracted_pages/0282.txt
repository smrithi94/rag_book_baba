On Directly Experiencing
the Presence of God
(A Talk to a Gathering of Sai Devotees)
Baba, in conversation this year, said something which is a great 
secret, for I have never heard him say it before. He told me that 
that which happens physically, on the outside, in terms of actions 
and so on, is not of major importance — that what is important is 
that which comes from the inside. It is the inside that changes the 
outside and not the outside that brings about the change inside. 
For example, Baba went on to say, "Take a car: it is driven from 
the inside." It seems from that statement, that what we must do 
now is to look inward and then bring it to the outside.
What is this inside activity that is going to change the outside? It 
is love. Love is the most powerful force in creation! Baba says 
that it is because of love that the universe was created, and the 
whole Cosmos is just a dance of love. So, we should be thinking 
of God all the time, praying to Baba, talking to him, keeping our 
mind with him. In this manner, when we affirm, or rather cease to 
deny that love, which is our true nature, and which can be brought 
to the forefront and expressed by loving God, then that love, that 
inside purity will come out and will change the outside cir-
cumstances.
Now, how are we going to practice this, to uncover this inner love 
for God which is there and of which we may not be aware?
