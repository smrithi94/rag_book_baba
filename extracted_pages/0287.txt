270 MY BABA AND I
sight of this fact. Of all the millions, all the billions of people in the 
world, how many know Sri Sathya Sai Baba? How many go to 
India to see Sai? How many read his books and consider his teach-
ings? How many look for him in their hearts and feel love for him, 
devotion to him, feel his love for them? Of all the millions in the 
world, it is just a handful.
To let that great chance go because of lack of thought, because of 
lack of consideration, is really and truly a crime.
So many times we are born, so much suffering we have gone 
through, so much desperation we have felt. The chance is here for 
us to be free of the quicksand, to reach the firm bank, to realize the 
divinity which Baba says is our true nature, to feel and be that 
which never changes, which is always the same, that bliss that 
passes all understanding, that peace that passes all understanding . . 
. That is within the grasp of everyone of us!
Any day, any moment we forget, it is a day lost, a moment lost! 
How quickly our life passes away, how rapidly the years go by! In 
no time at all it's all over, we're too old to pay attention, and the 
opportunity is lost, when and where to come again? Every life is 
taken on to work out a certain load of Karma — the next life, who 
knows what karma will come into play? Who knows what our 
circumstances will be, where we will be? This opportunity, so 
tangible, so precious — once lost may be gone for so long — aeons 
of time!
Every day we should remind ourselves of our heritage, of our 
opportunity, of the meaning of our life right now, and pray to Baba, 
pray to the Lord to help us realize that!
