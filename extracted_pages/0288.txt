To Sum It Up
Baba has told us that as long as the ego-mind is the charioteer of 
our lives, we will never be able to know the changeless Truth; and 
that until we know the truth of ourselves we will continue with 
birth, death, rebirth, temporary joys, and inevitable suffering. 
Mind, ego, concepts, reactions, and tendencies must be perceived 
and acknowledged as that which is experienced but which is not 
oneself. In order to know the full and real truth about oneself, one 
will need to make this inquiry the dominant interest of one's life.

An eternity of what we are experiencing now and have experi-
enced in the past is ours, if such be our choice. Baba has clearly 
told us that birth, death, and rebirth is a game of our own choos-
ing. But if we have enjoyed our game enough and now yearn for 
realization of "that peace which passeth all understanding," then 
Baba offers to help us "awaken."
We are told by Baba that a divine incarnation is an extraordinary 
circumstance beyond the possibility of verbal description. He tells us 
that the time is ripe for us to realize the absolute goal of all life — 
reunion with Godhead, and that it will be a major tragedy for us if we 
waste this unique lifetime in the pursuit of worldly desires, worldly 
ambitions, and sensory enjoyments. This challenge
