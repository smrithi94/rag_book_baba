280 MY BABA AND I
it will do away with mountains of anxiety and will add much en-
thusiasm to the way we carry out action. For myself, my mind, by 
now, constantly recites the sacred name — for me it is "Om Sai 
Ram" — and when things happen as they do, I say and feel, "Thy 
Will, Lord." I act with my maximum energy and according to my 
duty, as duty becomes apparent, and say and feel, "Thy Will, Lord." 
And I accept the consequence of action without worry —feeling 
and saying, "Thy Will, Lord." If I happen to forget this base, this 
viewpoint, I recollect and again take this position.
